 Yesterday was the National Day of France and the birthday of Sechelariu brothers in Bacau town.
The European TV stations broadcast footage of an impressive parade in Paris.
The TV and radio stations in Bacau reported on the party thrown by the two guys onwhom the fate has smiled.
The town is the origin of one of the most powerful economic, financial and political group in Romania.
Though he is a pretty controversial figure in the media, mayor Dumitru Sechelariu is nevertheless the town's first man.
He won the elections without going through the agitation of mind typical of such events, he has managed the town's affairs in a way agreed by his fellow citizens and offered them all the chance to be proud of having a professional league football team.
To cut a long story short, Dumitru Sechelariu is setting the rules of the game in Bacau and he always wins with support from the town's inhabitants.
The fact that Dumitru Sechelariu has gone into politics joining the ruling party PSD and that he has a brother who's a government member is a different story.
But this is not the issue now.
All we intend to do is comment on a fact which as far as we know hasn't occurred in any other place in Romania.
On his birthday, and his brother's birthday, the mayor offered free food and drinks to all the people who were gathered in Cancicov Park.
Besides, he organized a charity lunch where hundreds of local top figures were asked to donate money to the poor.
At a first sight we could say this was a moving gesture.
Here's a man who has done what nobody else has done before.
He invited the whole town to his birthday party and distributed sausage and drink tickets.
We could say the invitation launched by Bacau mayor was commendable.
He made the population happy by throwing a party and giving them some food and at the same time he showed the kind of generosity nobody in our country had shown before.
Now really, why hasn't anybody dome such a gorgeous thing before?
As far as we know there hasn't been something similar over the last decades, not only in Romaniabut also in the civilized world.
The only gesture that could be a smaller-scale match for this move was the one made by a farming engineer who offered food and drinks to all passengers who happened to be in Simeria railway station just because his mother-in-law had died and so he had got rid of her.
Apart from that, I haven't heard of any mayor or minister in France, Great Britain, Italy, the United States of America or Germany offering drinks to a whole town.
Maybe this does happen somewhere in Africa or Latin America or in some village populated by some clan chief's relatives.
Had Dumitru Sechelariu thrown this party any other day of the year, it might have been hard for us to find any fault with it.
But throwing such a party for his birthday sounds like hell.
It smells like propaganda plus a degree of ostentation that drives things beyond an acceptable boundary.
In my opinion, Sechelariu brothers' bizarre idea is also a matter of bad taste.
Why do I say that?
Because I don't think that Bacau mayor has used all the methods and ways through which he could have made himself useful to his community.
On the contrary, we can say that Dumitru Sechelariu has become a winner mainly thanks to the popular support he's got and that he owes part of his welfare to his fellow citizens.
His gesture rather falls under the class of cheap populism and is worth being filed under the slogan "bread and circus show".
