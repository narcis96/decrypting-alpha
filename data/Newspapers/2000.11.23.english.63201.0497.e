the disastrous campaign debate on Tuesday night hosted by the national television channel 1 was mainly to Gyorgy Frunda 's advantage . 
the Hungarian ethnic missed the debate and therefore he didn't have to participate in yet another disagreeable show . 
in addition , he didn't have to deal with queer scenarios or to think of what he would do if the bogey man should come or if the moon should fall down on earth . 
Frunda conveyed his message in a nice elegant way and he can say he didn't miss the debate , but at the same time avoided to sit at the same table with Corneliu Vadim Tudor . 
all the debates under the election campaign have had an artificial character . 
Romania 's serious problems have been left out of these spurious shows . 
the candidates selected the journalists who suited them so as to avoid any problems during the discussions and the national television devised a perfect ordinary scout - like scenario . 
neither the presidential campaign debates , nor the parliamentary ones presented us with coherent offers or constructive discussions . 
Tuesday night on the national television the excessively planned talk show hosted by Irina Radu went haywire exactly because she tried to use a single debate pattern for six distinct public figures . 
but this also happened because the show 's scenario was devised to serve one purpose alone , namely to avoid discussions about the dramatic situation the country 's going through . 
and as the show unfolded in an artificial manner , the moderator lost control of it , and the long negotiated rules were trampled under foot . 
consequently , what we got was a sinister low - down show , the first to really show the measure of Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's madness . 
it was only at that moment that the Romanian electorate had the chance to see the naked emperor multiplied and magnified . 
it was the night before last night , when they started to make a show of themselves , that we could see the rulers we deserve in their full splendour . 
moreover , the talk show on the public television almost makes you feel the situation will be the same no matter which of them becomes Romania 's president . 
actually , the trend is to turn televised campaign debates in to sort of entertainment shows . 
except for the debate attempted by the national television channel 1 ( which finally offered us the same sort of a low - down show ) , the rest of televised campaign debates look like some show on political matters with Anton and Romica as guests . 
poor jokes , stupid tests , moronic questions , wooden language texts and foolish answers not commented on . 
if we were to fall from the moon right in an armchair in front of a TV set we could draw the conclusion that these debates are being staged in order for us to decide who 's to lead us through a grand carnival rather than who 's to get us out of a dramatic situation . 
which means confusion doesn't prevail among the elite or the political class segment alone . 
it has spread over all the segments of our society , from justice and mass media to public institutions and ordinary people . 
citizens may see themselves as saints , but they too seem contaminated with the diseases of those whom they are blaming . 
if we look a gain at the performance of those invited on the latest campaign show hosted by the national television station , we could say that was Theodor Stolojan 's evening . 
he seems to be the winner , because , besides other things , he had the courage to stand up to Corneliu Vadim Tudor , armed with pieces of evidence , logic and common sense . 
Petre Roman too tried to oppose the madness , but in his affected and unconvincing style , shouting that his father Valter Roman ( Erno Neulander ) had been a great Romanian patriot . 
Ion Iliescu kept a low profile . 
he didn't engage in disputes , he stood aloof , practising his wooden language which seemed politically candid in comparison to Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's excessive outburst . 
Mugur Isarescu and Teodor Melescanu can be considered the real loosers . 
they made no mistakes , but neither did they distinguish themselves . 
they simply reiterated the lessons we ' d already heard . 
the debate on Tuesday night showed us the fragility of the democratic structures in Romania . 
for ten years , everybody has been acting in breach of the law or behaviour rules at least once every day , and no politician or institution is able to oppose this fact . 
moreover , the National Audiovisual Council may now penalize the national television channel 1 though in fact it did nothing wrong . 
but the council isn't able to ban Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's access to mass media though he pushes behaviour rules and language beyond the limits people can put up with to the area dominated by animals with prominent snouts .
