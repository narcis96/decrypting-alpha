our country has mountains , hills , valleys , plains , and waters . 
Romanians live here . 
and in order to be able to say that somebody rules them , every four years citizens with the right to vote elect the parliament . 
the parliament has parliamentary committees . 
committees have members . 
they elect the committees ' chairmen . 
intelligence is not a must for a chairman . 
all he needs is to be elected for a term in office and to be a patriot . 
the chairman of the committee for education , science , youth and sports is Doctor of Science in Engineering professor Anghel Stanciu . 
driven by a noble feeling , he put forward to the Deputy Chamber a motion " on the education policies promoted in school textbooks on Romania 's history ( we skip the grammar errors , which show even Doctors in Science sometimes are not very familiar with their mother tongue ) . 
and uncle Basil , or , in other words , Vasile , learns the parliament yesterday was faced with a difficult problem . 
it wasn't about the collapse of the banking system , or the confused legislation or finance policies , or the tough life of people living in the country 's mountain , valley , hill and plain areas , or the mess in the heads of our rulers unable to prepare Romania for its admission to the European Union . 
the MPs ' sorrow was triggered by a professor in Transylvanian city of Cluj who dared whistle in the church . 
he drew up an unusual Romanian history textbook that struck terror in the Romanian nation and horrified people living in our country 's mountains , valleys , hills and plains . 
and instead of holding a meeting with the education minister to tell him Sir , we inform you that an unsuitable history textbook that got your approval risks to compromise the concept of alternative textbooks , the parliamentary education committee has stirred a national row . 
nobody would take in to account the fact that former great Romanian rulers such as Vlad Tepes or Mihai Viteazul were not in the high school final year curriculum , as they are dealt with in detail in history textbook for lower grades . 
the only idea stuck to the MPs ' minds was that those great historical figures were allotted only a few lines in the alternative history textbook for students in the final high school year . 
but that 's not the end of the story . 
the motion forwarded by the committee says that " forced destruction of myth and imposition of imaginary facts were the course of action in order to attain these ignoble goals " . 
this wording can make uncle Vasile ( or don Basil born in the Carpathians land ) draw the conclusion that either we are in deep trouble or there is much fog in the minds of the MPs writing this sort of motions . 
let 's say the issue will worry uncle Vasile so bad that it makes him abandon his sheep on the pasture or his plough in the field and rush to the parliament . 
cause he feels he can't keep hands in pockets at a time when the Romanian nation is in danger . 
he knocks on the education committee 's office door and asks the Doctor of Science chairman Sir , would you tell us how can one act ignobly by " forced destruction of myth and imposition of imaginary facts " ? 
but our ordinary man will find much harder to understand why the committee says that ancient Dacia ruler Decebal was " ignored , disparaged and ridiculed " because he had " sensual lips " . 
does this mean Decebal was a womanizer ? ! 
or were his lips thinner , but the professor in Cluj said just the opposite because sensual lips are in vogue nowadays ? 
and how come Roman emperor Trajan had a fringe ? 
and bow - tied Bula * will answer him uncle Vasile , you 're a moron , you are not worth having such MPs . 
you haven't understood that the whole thing is about some people 's " wish to assert themselves by upholding as absolute the principle of myth destruction and deliberately artificial separation of the national values from the European ones in order to attain an uncertain goal . " 
we kindly ask readers to read a gain these words without swearing at us , because all words being quoted are part of the motion signed by 64 deputies indignant over an unusual textbook . 
actually , MPs say the textbook is offensive because of " selective , unbalanced , unrelated to historical truth imposition of certain ideas included in the Recommendation number 1283 made by the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council . " 
this precious , but rather bare - footed sentence means that the devil is in the textbook developed by the poor professor in Cluj city . 
" the foreign spy agencies seek to set Romanians at variance " and planted " the bomb " in a textbook blindly approved by the Education Ministry . 
dear reader , please stay at home and attend to your own business ! 
the Romanian parliament will keep up its fight to death so that Decebal be not depicted as a man with sensual lips and Trajan as a short cropped emperor . 
you ' ll be informed on what has been decided in connection with Vlad Tepes ' eyes and the horse belonging to Mihai Viteazul . 
and in case you are starving , vote that Decebal was a lion - hearted leader fluent in three foreign languages except for Hungarian and that he was a member of the Greater Romania Party !
