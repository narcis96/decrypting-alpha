death took its toll in the Jiu Valley coalfield . 
it came , levied its toll , and went further without leaving word of when it would be back , though the miners know that their existence under the star of fatality involves both the daily danger and the periodic tribute . 
here , life , beyond the joys and sorrows of every day life , is measured in expectations . 
when and who ? 
if there is despair and resignation in the souls of those who live in the area , if they have got used to death as the inhabitants of Bucharest city have got used to having the stray dogs around , this doesn't mean that the place is cursed and that we can only expect to hear the news announcing the fulfillment of destiny . 
there are a lot of escape routes , of ways to light , of forms through which tragic moments can be avoided in the Jiu Valley . 
but we have never went all the way . 
at every " event " , after the pathos of the first reactions , revolt is taking shape . 
we can't go on like this ! 
we can't wait any more ! 
something must be done ! 
this time the political reaction was quite up to the mark . 
the premier interrupted his vacation , an inquiry commission was set up , and in order to ease suffering pledges to offer financial support to the families of the victims were made . 
we might even say that these days Romania 's heart goes out to the families of the victims . 
what about tomorrow ? 
what about next year ? 
time will pass and the pledges in the papers will get covered with dust in the drawers , the national road crossing the mountains will not stretch beyond the covers of a file in order to climb stone shoulders and go down on the serpentine roads from the Virful lui Neag peak . 
the factories in which the women from the Jiu Valley should work will only reach the stage of credit negotiations , the status of disadvantaged area will only bring tax facilities - hunters , the budget will not be sufficient to buy a few hundreds of methane detectors because the money will be wasted on the way . 
this will happen because there are no victims among those working as government clerks , there are no labour accidents in the ministries , because no galleries crumble in the town councils or town halls . 
a whole world who lives on public money shows its inability to find solutions in the dangerous galleries , in the dead they blame on fate . 
even the attempts to release former miners ' leader Miron Cozma from prison are just small prizes , aimed at covering up a deep inability of the state mechanisms . 
they resemble the stupid proposals to send miners to pick up fruit , to pardon convict because the prisons are overcrowded , and many others which show us that we still believe that death can be faced with coloured balloons , with wild flowers and baskets full of wild fruit . 
it is a vicious circle . Romania doesn't have time or money or experts to fight poverty and death in the Jiu Valley coalfield , whereas the miners ' violent reactions cause only fear and pretexts for postponement . 
they revolt that they are no longer treated as they used to be and the others apologize because they cannot forget what the miners did . 
and in this vicious circle , where there are all sorts of people who are guilty or irresponsible , where days go at a steady pace , death takes its toll to show us once a gain the places where we are unable to do anything .
