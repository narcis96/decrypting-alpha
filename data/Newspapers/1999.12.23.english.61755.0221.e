this year 's commemoration of December ' 89 did not inflame spirits as much as in previous years . 
the people 's memory seems to have calmed down . 
on the other hand historical research has not made very much progress . 
researchers have not got to the archives where the key to all events may be . 
some day all this will be unlocked and it is then that we will know what happened . 
until then , the image of 1989 's events remain connected to the revolutionaries . 
i saw Dan Iosif the other night , proud and pathetic , displeased only with the media 's attitude towards him . 
moreover , the well - known character believes newspapers and televisions dented the image of the December hero . 
Dan Iosif even says that journalists assailed the revolutionaries because " they are peeved about not having been in our shoes " . 
i don't think this is true . 
to my knowledge , Romanians highly esteem Ion Monoran , Ion Savu in Timisoara , Calin Nemes and many other hundreds , thousands of people . 
in every town and city there were people who risked their life because they overcame unconcernedness and felt the time came for us to put and end to the aberrations of the system . 
many of them are not known a cross the country . 
they did not make waves , they did not crowd before cameras . 
some of them did not even take their revolutionary 's certificates . 
they found this to be beneath their dignity . 
and I think they do enjoy their fellows ' esteem . 
they really deserve to be brought in the limelight to enjoy the public respect they are entitled to . 
not all Romanians took risks , not all lost somebody , not all felt death drawing closer while still defying it to open the gates to freedom . 
unfortunately , not even in December 1989 , while the Socialist equalitarianism was at its height , were we equal . 
and nobody tried to downplay the merits of those who came to the forefront of the waiting crowd . 
what has followed since January 1990 is not the work of the media . 
it was not the media that distributed the revolutionary 's certificates or made a bargain of this . 
it was not the newspapers and the televisions that fought to be granted privileges , that is tax exemptions , commercial premises and plots of land for free . 
it was not the journalists that wanted the revolutionaries to be dragged in to the haggling over the worth of those moments of courage . 
it was those who back then were riding the wave that said a pay for heroism is in order . 
and it was still the ravenous that said this pay should be as high as possible . 
both Dan Iosif and most of the revolutionaries failed to realize that this would not lead to statues and the respect of the community , but to its unconcernedness . 
nobody disputes Dan Iosif 's courage . 
contempt does not stem from his being on the barricade back then , but from what he has been doing ever since . 
he got involved in schemes , arrangements , affairs and has had unnatural reactions , by performing on the political stage as if tethered and by triggering the people 's disgust . 
Dan Iosif , Bebe Ivanovici and a few others did a big harm to those who could have been symbols of change . 
they dragged them in to disputes , got them involved in petty interests by ridiculing thus the morality of some people of unquestionable integrity . 
i don't think there is a single Romanian who opposes the idea that those injured and the families of those who died in December 1989 events be granted reparations or compensations . 
i for one believe the Romanian state is doing too little for them . 
but this is one thing , and what the tens of thousands of official paper holders want is a completely different thing . 
many turned the moments of courage in to a business they run to their advantage . 
" gratitude " Ltd , run by all kind of adventurers and heroes in name , caused the big doubt cast on them to spread over the names of those who defied death for the sake of freedom . 
and Dan Iosif falls under the latter category . 
unfortunately for him , it is he ( one of the bravest Romanians back then ) that has caused , by his subsequent behaviour , a question mark to be raised on an entire category whose conduct however should not be mistaken for his . 
all this stems from the attempt to estimate the equivalent value in money , plots of land and commercial premises of some moments that can mirror but the man 's inner beauty . 
as December is the month of love , not of selfishness , we all remember with gratitude all those who had the strength to show us we are not some ugly beings .
