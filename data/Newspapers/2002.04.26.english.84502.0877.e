when I wrote " Chance and prejudice " I didn't mean to hurt you at all . 
it was not my wish to persuade anybody to get back home . 
nor to thin out the number of those who are thinking of leaving . 
it would have been naive of me to set myself against the tide of life . 
at the same time , I can't keep back the fact that I ' m sick of hearing that endless I ' m going a way , I ' m leaving , I ' ll split , this is no place to live . 
i do understand countryside people , miners and the jobless . 
they can't make a living and they would settle for any sort of work in any place abroad . 
i even wrote once about that urging them to leave . 
that 's no disaster . 
you go and make money , get it back home , learn to work and involuntary " import " both market economy and democracy . 
my reaction did not concern the latter or the young women going to work as club dancers God knows where and dreaming of getting married to some big shot owning a yacht and helicopter . 
what annoyed me was the desire to go abroad harbored by people I felt they could have made it even in this wretched transitional times . 
maybe many get contaminated by other people who left abroad . 
maybe some are exasperated with the " benefits " of official institutions at home . 
and their nervous system yields under pressure . 
they are the ones I wanted to send a sign of encouragement to . 
i wanted to tell them to try once more . 
because it can be done . 
it 's true the price is huge . 
you feel like breaking down the doors you knock on in vain , to sting the civil servants , inspectors , policemen and politicians ' indifference till blood comes out when you know your request is logic , simple and legal and they send you from pillar to post just to make you empty your pockets . 
or just because they 're damn mean . 
in order to make it in Romania , you need steel nerves and bones , you need to be as stubborn as a mule and as quick as a fox , and besides a supportive body you need long days of 30 - 40 hours , the strength to cope with loneliness and the lack of common sense , plus an atrophic lobe in the brain emisphere responsible for joy and pleasure . 
then , if your rival ( or the ruling power ) doesn't resort to a tank to crush you , you ' ll surely make it . 
i can guarantee you that in writing . 
I brought up the subject a gain prompted by the 150 messages received ( plus 15,000 visitors of our website ) . 
most of them came from abroad . 
i don't know whether it was you using those swearwords or your folks at home . 
but don't worry . 
they too gave me good thoughts . 
i took them as an attempt to rid yourself of the suffering caused by what 's going on at home . 
but even to those who showed no mercy to me I would tell the same thing . 
no matter how far you may go and how high you may raise yourself , you ' ll never get free of Romania 's bitter - sweet curse . 
it was injected to you at your birth and it will go a way only after your name has burned out . 
in this respect , we are not at all different from one another . 
if you have already left , I wish you God speed . 
enjoy your life and come back home once in a while . 
maybe something 's changed inside you or the places where you set out on your journey . 
or just because , not to forget who you really are . 
if you 're packing , follow your mind . 
if you feel you ' ve had enough and you are staring at a map not knowing what place to choose , then listen to me carefully . 
clench your teeth , go on cursing a couple of days and try once a gain . 
i assure you it will be awfully hard , but it can be done . 
that 's the big gain . 
and keep in mind one thing , as Constantin P . 
Kavafis put it : " New lands you will not find . 
the city will follow you . You will roam the same streets . 
as you have ruined your life here in this little corner , you have destroyed it in the whole world " . 
and if wherever you go you get successful , think about it . 
it means you were meant to be successful at home as well .
