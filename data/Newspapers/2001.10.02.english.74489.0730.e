the " taliban " and " terrorist " Ion Iliescu had a decent reaction to all the delirious statements made by Vadim bin Laden ( Corneliu Vadim Tudor ) in " Romania Mare " magazine . 
he announced that he would never meet with the president of the Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) a gain . 
it 's a very natural attitude . 
you cannot talk to someone who insults you in all ways possible . 
even if you were made of stone , there still comes a moment when you slap him in the face . 
at the same time , the presidential institution announced that the authorities concerned took notice of the serious statements made by the Madman , as they can cause huge damages to Romania 's image . 
the point we don't understand is simple . 
Ion Iliescu is in general very preoccupied about Romania . 
but , in this case , we cannot realize how much of his irritation comes from the insults hurled by Vadim at him and how much from the damages caused to the country . 
whether we like it or not , we come to ask ourselves a simple question . 
is it the country more important that ten people ? 
because ten people ( though the number of those smeared by Vadim actually reaches hundreds ) mean nothing to the president as compared to himself or the country . 
why am I saying this ? 
because the president of Romania has tolerated Vadim 's aberrant behaviour for eleven years . 
only when Vadim bin Laden 's mud was thrown at Ion Iliescu , the state institutions reacted . 
when his insults were hurled at the others , the president and those around him had a lot of fun . 
they didn't consider it was their responsibility to intervene to put the madman in his place . 
the Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) didn't make any move either . 
Nicolae Vacaroiu discreetly tolerated the madman and didn't even dissociate himself from Vadim when he was slandered in the worst way possible . 
and this is not only about Vacaroiu . 
a whole group from the party led by Adrian Nastase has contacts behind the scene with this local bin Laden . 
as a matter of fact , the differences in thinking and in political attitude between these and the Greater Romania Party are almost imperceptible . 
if not even president Ion Iliescu 's irritation will lead to a legal measure taken against Corneliu Vadim Tudor there is nothing else we can do . 
it means that in Romania no person and no institution can handle this extremist , neither the hundreds of individuals who have been slandered , nor the tarnished parties , nor the smeared civil servants , nor the neighbouring countries and the international institutions . 
if this last attempt made by president Ion Iliescu fails or ends in smoke , then we are forced to accept a very clear thing . 
today 's Romania is practically ruled by an extremist . 
he is not in power , he didn't win the elections , he is not part of a government coalition , but he controls all the rule - of - law institutions . 
that is , he rules Romania by technics which are not perceived by all the democratic institutions of this state . 
obviously , then it 's a state which only pretends to be a rule - of - law one . 
such a conclusion is not at all absurd . 
if not all of it is true , then it 's not far from the truth anyway . 
we have to ask ourselves a question which needs an answer . 
wouldn't be better for us to go though the dictatorship of this madman so that the country may consume all the residues that feed him ? 
this way we will know how we stand ! 
and we will do a way for good with this political aberration called Corneliu Vadim Tudor , whom we also call Vadim bin Laden !
