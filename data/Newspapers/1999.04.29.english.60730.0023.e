at a meeting of minister of the interior Dudu Ionescu with a few newspaper directors I was so close I couldn't help noticing some details . 
on the minister 's cell phone there was written " PNTCD " . 
this amused me until I saw Dudu Ionescu producing a wallet - agenda , with PNTCD written in blue on its cover . 
maybe the Christian - Democrat wanted to see how the two items look with a transfer stuck on them , or maybe he wants to always bear in mind whose party he is a member of . 
or maybe the seniors in the party like to see the party insignia on the members ' suitcase , shoes and hat , as they take this as a sign of loyalty . 
or maybe the interior minister marked his cell phone and wallet with the party 's name so that they can be brought to the party quarters in case they are lost or stolen . 
these details ruined my whole evening and were a real hindrance to me . 
instead of watching his sentences , I tried to figure out a man through these two rather funny details . 
maybe Dudu Ionescu has no sense of humour , considering that he used to be secretary of state with the Defence Ministry , where jokes are forbidden . 
anyway , the two transfers intrigued me because they don't seem to match the person . 
Dudu Ionescu is a rather reserved man , with a political discourse with no frills and without charm when he is on TV . 
i believe him to be the kind of midfielder nobody applauds , with all his numerous passes and his exhausting races a cross the field . 
and the manner in which he made his debut inside the Interior Ministry proves he is not faint - hearted . 
he was scared neither of the miners ' threats , nor of the political games or dealings of certain generals and colonels . 
he had Cozma and the bad guys locked up in a wink , by shattering in a single night everything that had been Romania 's fear since 1990 . 
i mean there are only a few those who could cope with such a tense moment . 
moreover , by pulverizing the concept of miners ' rampage as other minister couldn't - be they generals or not - Dudu Ionescu managed to give meaning to the concept of a civilian heading the police . 
at the talks where I noticed the transfers Dudu Ionescu briefly spoke about the police reform . 
but it was plain to see that he was set on going ahead with it and that he knows what this involves . 
yesterday the interior minister confirmed what " Evenimentul zilei " reported some weeks before , namely the replacement of some generals . 
he did not say much about the reasons for their replacement . 
maybe ordinary people , if they were in the position to learn the real reasons , would be appalled and an awful circus would begin in Romania . 
instead of a showdown , minister Dudu Ionescu chose the more elegant formula of appointments , promotions and switching some dinosaurs on the dead track . 
the method has the disadvantage of hushing up many outrageous things , but it also has the merit of keeping within the system the powerful enough men who otherwise could have slid towards opposing political parties , particularly towards the Greater Romania Party . 
we don't know what the spectacular outcome of this changes at top levels of the ministry can be . 
of course this turned some paths to smuggle and lawbreakers in to dead ends . 
it is just a beginning . 
it is possible that these paths will reopen after a while or that the minister 's determination will bring him further achievements in this campaign . 
restructuring cannot stop here and implementing it at the level of the traffic policemen , that is bringing about a change in their attitude and providing them with the appropriate equipment , requires time and money . Presumably policemen will take the new air in the ministry as a red flag and many of them will slow down their wheeling - and - dealing , bribe - taking and arrangements at the expense of citizens . 
after all it is important that a clear signal comes from the leadership of an institution that old methods won't work any longer , that all those who won't comply with the strict job requirements are to walk out . 
Dudu Ionescu can be hardly included among the Christian - Democrats who have roused the people 's dislike . 
the inside of a benumbed ministry has triggered much more hostility . 
maybe the very courage to face all these shortcomings will benefit his image in the eyes of the ordinary people sick and tired with the rottenness inside the system . 
in order to achieve this he only has to carry on what he began , without sticking transfers on his cell phone and wallet .
