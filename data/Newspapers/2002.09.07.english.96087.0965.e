three quarters of Europe , a tiny part of Africa ( because the rest of it has no interest in the subject whatsoever ) , plus the United States of America and Canada are speaking about and pointing an accusing finger at the corruption plague in Romania . 
mister Adrian Nastase pretends everything 's all right while the laundering machinery is whitening his clients and Mrs Rodica Stanoiu , Minister of Justice , sends us a communique that reads : " Bla bla bla bla bla bla " 
p . S . Mrs Minister and dear Press Office , be so kind as to no longer pretend that you understand nothing of the tragedy experienced by our fellow countrymen who happen to get in to the claws of the mechanism you are shepherding . The Romanian justice system has lost its last trace of credibility and brought disgrace upon itself .
