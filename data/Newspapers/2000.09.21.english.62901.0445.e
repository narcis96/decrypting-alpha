we too , like our readers , will read newspapers and watch TV programmes . 
the difference is that our journalistic experience helps us " smell " faster things that are too thin to hold to close scrutiny . 
because they either won't match or are in total contradiction with the information we hold . 
and no other source can confirm this information . 
moreover , the data we are speaking of seem to serve the interests of a group of people or of a person . 
another technique used to " identify " a fake piece of information is to subject it to a test of logic analysis . 
you go asking all the possible questions and see whether the story still holds good . 
or you can call some people who are linked to the subject in question . 
small office workers , neighbours , people prying in to other people 's affairs . 
what governments , ministries , secret services and other important institutions try to keep under wraps is regularly common knowledge to kids hanging out in parking lots , to cleaning ladies or car drivers . 
if you are lucky to run in to a smart taxi driver you won't even need to go around asking questions . 
do you remember the story of an engineer named Popescu who in the eighties was thrown out through the window of the Romanian Embassy in Paris and was found dead on the sidewalk ? 
in the " transatlantic " apartment I lived at that time in Drumul Taberei neighbourhood the engineer was known as spy Popescu living on the x floor . 
when the kids in the parking lot told me the story I thought it was nothing but a joke . 
it was only when I heard the news on the " Europa Libera " radio that I made the connection with what the kids had told me . 
i mentioned all these to make things clear to our readers . 
we lack both infallible journalistic research techniques , and sophisticated devices to find out the truth . 
all we can do is conduct some research , gather papers , statements and pieces of evidence , and sometimes even count on rumours . 
sometimes it will take months to have a bit of information confirmed . 
other times this will happen in a matter of days . 
out of the blue you come in to the possession of the document you miss and which proves your hunch was right . 
sometimes we make mistakes under the pressure of time . 
the only piece of advice I can give is that people should not jump at conclusions . 
especially readers , because they are not in danger of missing the night trains or the trucks shipping the press . 
they have enough time , a day , or two , or a week , to get the real picture of the event , or at least the picture closer to the truth . 
this common sense guide could be of extreme help now that the nation is being bombarded with all sorts of weird news reports and statements . 
for example , a former Special Security Service ( SPP ) captain Catalin Tanase , sentenced to jail in connection with the " Tigareta II " smuggling case , keeps giving interviews with some gutter publications about the presidency 's men 's involvement in the smuggling case . 
as the saying goes " there 's no smoke without fire " or as people say there must be a grain of truth in any allegation , people may be inclined to believe what the man says . 
talks with this bomb - launcher convict have been tape recorded and then broadcast on TELE 7 abc station . 
it has to be said the host of these interviews is the same person who managed to talk with Gheorghe Trutulescu at the time when the latter was under nation - wide search . 
basic common sense makes us wonder how the above - mentioned guy ( he should pass some more tests , a Romanian language test included , in order to deserve being called a journalist ) has come to interview a convict ? 
because we haven't manage to get an approval to talk with any of the people sentenced in connection with the " Tigareta II " smuggling case . 
how on earth has someone close to Dumitru Dragomir ( a lumpen person , but also an appendix of the secret services " have - been " and close to the main opposition party PDSR ) managed to get an interview with a convict ? 
could it be just a matter of tremendous coincidence that the recording was aired by TELE 7 abc ( this media shack with visible political label ) ? 
and also as if by chance , Ion Honcescu , the head of the lower house committee to investigate abuses , takes over the cause launched by the convict and turns it in to a parliamentary investigation . 
an extraordinary coincidence too made the sister of assassinated union leader Sahleanu to be invited on a TELE 7 abc show where she said bagfuls of money came from Iasi for Romania 's president 's son Dragos Constantinescu . 
and another politician asks for an investigation to be started . 
why didn't the woman go to the police or to the Prosecutor 's Office to help investigators ? 
out of the blue she meets a politician and ends up on a TV show . 
and her statements on the show aimed for the same target as those made by the former officer currently behind the bars , who too made his statements on the TELE 7 abc station and triggered reactions in the parliament . 
i swear we have no evidence to say it loud and clear that this is true . 
or to say we have to deal with a blatant lie . 
there are many things that do not match , but others are interconnected in a certain way . 
it seems to me it smells of a sly campaign !
