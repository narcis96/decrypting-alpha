famous as a hunter , Romania 's prime minister burst out ! 
extremely upset with the contents of Armagedon II Report , he asked for measures to be taken . 
and the police and the Prosecutor 's Office , as obedient as obedience can get , mobilized so that as soon as possible they might give the premier on a plate a person and some forces responsible for such an impertinence . 
the Armagedon II Report ( focused on Adrian Nastase 's personal wealth and his connections with questionable businessmen and interest groups ) has so far been just a news story . 
but it hasn't become a topic of national interest , especially because many of the affirmations in the report were already known . 
some of them are hard to be denied even by a parliamentary commission . 
only somebody who wanted to get the prime minister in deep trouble could give him such a bad piece of advice . 
start the angel hunt and show them who you are ! 
and if such a moron subordinate does not exist ( though we could suspect several of them ) , then the only option to be taken in to account is that the prime minister himself asked for revenge measures . 
and exactly like in a preletcultist movie in the fifties , on Friday night the prosecutors apprehended a man on the street , and on Saturday morning the office workers at the Prosecutor 's Office called newspapers desks , radio and TV stations to summon the media to a press conference of wide interest . 
and at the press conference , the best civil servants rushed to read out a communique , and then went a way , and in the evening , all the TV stations broadcast the confession of a computer company manager who said he had been told to enter the Armagedon II Report on the Internet . 
we want to explain something to our readers . 
prosecutors arrest tens of people . 
and most often they don't inform the press on their doings . 
and they never make the evidence available to the press . 
this time , the computer company manager appeared on all TV stations , video recorded by prosecutors and shown to the Romanian nation while admitting of having committed the big " crime " of making the report public . 
even ordinary people with no knowledge of the matter realized the Prosecutor General 's Office wanted to show the Romanian people a guilty person and to report to the prime minister they had accomplished their mission . 
the arrest of a " computer man " and the remanding in to custody of a dignitary ( be they the authors of the report ) are an unprecedented fact . 
after Romania was the country where thousands of false information was put in to circulation , this is the first time when the authors are busted and cuffed . 
nobody has done anything against those who spread false information about the economy , the country , the state institutions or private persons . 
Adrian Nastase laughed in his sleeve when Corneliu Vadim Tudor put in to circulation false information about official institutions and ordinary citizens . 
he didn't lift a finger . 
nor did the Prosecutor 's Office in the case of more serious affirmations referring to coup d ' etat attempts . 
the authorized institutions reacted in no way in the case of true information about blatant law breakings . 
and suddenly , when a report on the prime minister 's assets and businesses is made public , the state institutions react violently . 
the fall of the Romanian Discount Bank , the vanishing of the money invested by people in the National Mutual Fund FNI , the dubious selloffs carried out by the current and previous rulers aren't a problem any more . 
the police and prosecutors move in to action to save the prime minister 's honour ( already tarnished ) and to protect his reputation ( on the down ) . 
the result is disastrous . 
it is only now that the affirmations in the Armagedon II Report become known to all Romanians and it is only now that Adrian Nastase is in the situation of being perceived as a person who has gone too far . 
only now the population and the party headed by the prime minister are forced to take cognizance of many affirmations in the Armagedon II Report that are true , and of the fact that no matter what he may say , the prime minister can't be credible . 
Adrian Nastase laid it on thick . 
when he travelled the country by Ceausescu 's train , we said O . K . , he 's busy and in a hurry . 
when on his country tours he was received with full military honours , though such a ceremony is reserved to the state head only , we said well , maybe some overzealous bootlicker was behind the move . 
when he turned the government 's watchdog in to the prime minister 's watchdog we said maybe it was good for him to have a mobile and efficient body to check on the signals coming from the real life . 
but Adrian Nastase now wants a personal Prosecutor 's Office ( to fight corruption ) , though he hasn't yet made public his famous programme to fight the above - mentioned plague . 
the premier got carried a way and wants supplementary bodies to rule the country . 
his behaviour at the end of last week shows us he is ready to use them first of all to the benefit of his own image and power interests . 
as of this moment , many people have entered a state of alert . 
anything is possible . 
to be busted in the street if we talk about His art collection received in gift at his birthday anniversary , if we talk about His weekend in Canada ( paid by whom ? ) when he was in the United States , if we discuss about the existence or non - existence of those video tapes that shows him or someone close to him on a visit on a pontoon . 
we should expect our phones to be tapped , our homes to be searched for audio or video cassettes , anything that could prove something about questionable doings by the prime minister . 
he is a political God and he who raises his voice against him or says something about him will be punished . 
it wouldn't matter if we were angels , cause the prime minister 's revenge would chase us even in a snake 's hole . 
this would mean the beginning of a new stage in Romania 's history , one we haven't dreamed of even in our darkest moments over the last years . 
everything that has happened since Friday night onwards , everything the police and the prosecutors have done show us an Adrian Nastase with a certain sort of character and a certain sort of understanding public performance . 
both are giving us shivers . 
the Country 's First Hunter , for the sake of his office and image , is ready to start a war , including one to massacre the angels .
