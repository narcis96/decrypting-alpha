Silviu Brucan , in the role of famous fortune - teller Omida , said on Sunday that there is no place in the government for Theodor Stolojan for the simple reason that there is no room in the cabinet for two specialists in economics . 
things would stay somehow different in a government run by Adrian Nastase or Teodor Melescanu . 
this viewpoint would be fairly correct if Radu Vasile were an economist , not a history school graduate and a good professor in the history of economic doctrines . 
nobody says it 's a shame for someone to be a historian , even if economic doctrines are your field of study . 
the supporting proof for such a statement is the fact that this field of profession can make you a premier . 
but the real reason stands somewhere else . 
Radu Vasile has violently dismissed a possible involvement of Theodor Stolojan in the government affairs saying the latter is not a ruling coalition member . 
this is the only significant objection . 
Knack made Radu Vasile say Theodor Stolojan could be taken in the government only following a cabinet reshuffle . 
Radu Vasile is right from a legal viewpoint . 
this move would have called for the amendment of the legislation laying down rules for the government organisation , coalition debates and a decision to appoint the person going to hold such a post . 
it would have taken some time to do this with complete observance of the law . 
and there was no other possible way , except for resorting to a typical Romanian procedure . 
that is , to work this out overnight . 
but this can't be done because of the conflicting inflated egos and viewpoints involved . 
Radu Vasile doesn't want Stolojan , and therefore he says the move would be against the law . 
he lacks the guts to say sure , we 're open to cooperation and consultation with anybody able to assist us or to come up with a good idea that might help us break the deadlock . 
in such a situation , the prime minister would have run the risk to see Stolojan making him a public offer . 
here I am , ready to lend you a helping hand ! 
under such circumstances , the prime minister would have been in the situation of comparing ( or even confront ) his often amateurish reactions with the scrupulousness of a stubborn person who also has the experience of the World Bank . 
and so , the formula of stirring a circus around the fact that Stolojan is not a coalition member and the egotistic reasoning have prevailed over the advantage of having a plus of competence injected in the government . 
Emil Constantinescu , on the other hand , tested the water . 
he had never clearly stated his intentions . 
but he wanted to see the coalition 's reaction . 
suppose they approve the move , Stolojan joins the party which will cause him bear some of the governing brunt and calm down , while the government gains in competence . 
on the other hand , it 's no big deal if they don't approve it . Stolojan can join the Council for business climate improvement . 
this new gimmick after two and a half years in office sounds funny . 
we thought this improvement would come after the stepping down from office of the Romanian Party of Social Democracy . 
but we only came to the situation to try and fix what broke in the meantime . 
it shouldn't be up to the president to oversee the improvement of the business climate . 
it is the finances ( taxes ) , the parliament and the government ( through legislation or emergency ordinances ) and the central bank ( through its monetary policy ) that make economy work or bring it to a deadlock . 
and as the president couldn't get anything from the first two factors , he made himself a crutch with economic role . 
the president can but slightly freshen the business climate , as long as the prime minister sticks to his own ideas and the coalition MPs show distant in their relations with the presidency . 
there 's no way that the new forum set up by the presidential institution can do much . 
they will meet , share their opinions , submit propositions to the president , eventually cry on each other 's shoulder , and that 's all . 
the fact that no government member took part in the meeting at the presidential office is a sign that these projects stand slim chances to be put in to practice . 
no government member attended the meeting , as if there was no need for such a thing or as if our economy was stronger than the American one . 
it 's as though some well - meaning and worried people in some Bucharest neighbourhood gathered to make up an advisory body in order to work out a solution to a crisis in Angola . 
nobody gives a damn on what they 're doing , but they are proud of their political masterwork . 
in fact , it all boils down to a war of attrition , with conflicting Romanian - style inflated egos involved . 
we pretend we 're united and set to pull our beloved country out of the hole , but in private we kick each other until we see stars before our eyes . 
and progress is nothing but a slogan . 
invented by the mighty of the day .
