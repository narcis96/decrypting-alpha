for the first time in our lives we were officially presented a list of former political police collaborators . 
did anybody fall on their back ? 
did any revenge action take place ? 
did any of Marcian Bleahu 's colleagues jump at his throat ? 
did anybody hold Pavel Corut accountable ? 
did any official lecture Iulian Cretu ? 
it was as if announcing the score of a match between Mizil and Titu football teams . 
ordinary people were left cold at the news , though the TV stations and the press didn't miss the opportunity to inform on the fact . 
they didn't even bother to pick up the phone and let off steam against those in question . 
which means the whole fuss months and years ago over the passage of the law granting people access to their Securitate files and which was seen likely to generate a total mess , destroy families , friendship bonds or institutions proved pointless . 
people are quietly attending to their businesses . 
and had the law been passed right after 1990 we wouldn't have wasted so much time on endless disputes , spiteful debates or simply sick suspicions . We would have found out who was and who was not involved with the former political police . 
at that time we could have adopted a law to ban former communist dignitaries from holding high public offices . 
and the effects of these laws would be gone for some years now . 
this failed to happen , but this is no reason for us to take our lives . 
the law granting access to Securitate files is a good thing . 
we learn more about people who will represent us . 
and it 's our business to form an opinion on them and treat them accordingly . 
the candidates who signed declarations on their responsibility saying they didn't work for Securitate exposed themselves to ridicule . It 's one thing to have done something and feel sorry . 
and it 's another thing when there is evidence against your and you look as if butter would not melt in your mouth . 
and , furthermore , declare in writing that such a thing has never ever happened . 
he who does such a thing exposes himself to ridicule . 
but he won't go to jail or be slammed a fine . 
his image will be the only thing to suffer the consequences . 
those disclosed as having been collaborators of former political police will run for various offices tomorrow . 
it 's up to each elector to vote for them or not . 
democracy will prevail . 
but it 's hard to believe that Bucharest residents or the inhabitants of other cities in Romania won't think twice when it comes to choosing between a former securitate collaborator and a man with no shady past . 
they ' ll know what responsibility they take . 
maybe a person wants to vote for someone formerly involved with the Securitate . 
but he 's not alone . 
maybe there are many others who won't have anything to do with this candidate and vote accordingly . 
as the fact went almost unnoticed this time , the same is likely to happen in the fall . 
no matter how many candidates are exposed as formerly involved with the Securitate , people will quietly attend to their own businesses . 
and they will chose who to penalize when casting their votes . 
declaring their ties to the former political police may be to some candidates ' advantage . 
whether we like it or not , a certain percentage of the population sees the ties with the Securitate as a virtue , not a disgrace . 
the proof for this is the credit given to some politicians over the last ten years though it was well known they had made a living from snitching . 
the access to securitate files could cause problems to some pretentious politicians . 
considering all this , we may have a fall with politicians with a red mark pinned on them just like buildings with high risk of collapsing in case of an earthquake . 
p . S . I am writing all this during a talk one can make no head or tail of with the Bulgarian interior minister Emanoil Iordanov . 
we are telling him about the problems encountered by Romanians going through Bulgaria and he 's telling us he has never heard of such a thing . No complaint has been received since he took over the office .
