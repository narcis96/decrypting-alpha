Iulius Filip is not one of those stuck - up Romanians you can notice from afar . 
as if he was wondering whether his shadow was disturbing anyone . 
this short man with his straight nose and hands like tongs was behaving in the Palace of Justice like some student summoned to the headmaster 's office . 
as the cameras swept the court room where Werner Sommerauer from Brasov town was being questioned in the lawsuit filed against him by Ristea Priboi , Iulius Filip reached out and grabbed a national flag propping it against the bench in front of him . 
Iulius Filip did not participate in the workers 's upheaval in Brasov town . 
in 1987 he was fresh out of jail trying to contact Doina Cornea to joint sign protest messages denouncing the situation in Romania . 
so , Iulius Filip , from Cluj town , had not many reasons for coming to Bucharest a long with the workers from Brasov . 
but still , why did he take Romania 's flag in to the court room and why was he carrying tens of kilograms of documents ? 
it is only after Iulius Filip has opened his bag as spacious as a shelf in an archive department that you start to understand what this is all about . 
in 1977 , the worker from Cluj made common cause with the workers from Valea Jiului coalfield who were on strike because his father was among those who had risen against Nicolae Ceausescu . 
moreover , the young worker sent the dictator a poem entitled " Dream and hope " . 
it 's easy to imagine that the naive literary work by the locksmith from Cluj town wasn't conveying the same message as the bootlicking poems written by Adrian Paunescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor . 
that 's why he was arrested . 
this man with his cold , harsh , cast iron figure didn't bow to anybody . 
on the contrary , he started to write messages to Lech Walesa 's " Solidarity " trade union and to Radio Free Europe . 
Iulius Filip is one of the very few Romanians prosecuted over " propaganda against the socialist regime " . 
he spent some years in prison , he was sent to perform forced labour in the Apuseni Mountains and was forced to leave the country . 
he is not a man to be pushed aside as one may please . 
it is only when you come in to contact with him that you realize you deal with a man made of hard rock . 
and as his freedom and his fundamental rights had been damaged , Iulius Filip came back asking for justice to be done . 
in 1977 , the locksmith from Cluj town came back from America and started digging . 
the day had come for him to scour the Securitate archives for truth . 
and once a gain , like an obsession , he asked for his rights to be observed . 
" he had a hostile attitude and wrote various materials hostile to the socialist regime in our country " , says a collaboration plan in his Securitate file . 
" after he was arrested and convicted , he was worked on over the time of his detention , and he proved to be a hopeless , recalcitrant element who had not given up on his ideas and viewpoints , which is why he was frequently subject to disciplinary punishment " , says the same plan devised by Securitate . 
and if this Iulius Filip , an unassuming person and a man of high common sense , couldn't be bent by Nicolae Ceausescu 's Securitate even by 11 year jail sentences and other disciplinary punishments , how on earth can Ion Iliescu , Adrian Nastase and the other PSD big shots imagine that such a man can be stopped in his attempt to find out the truth about the way his life has been ruined ? 
trying to answer this question , we come to one of the most important problems of the Romanian society . 
and , whether we like it or not , of the party called PSD .
