for centuries , the Orthodox Church , besides the faith in God , has preached a certain subservient attitude towards rulers and authorities . 
but democracy , in its contemporary dimensions , urges us to do exactly the opposite . 
it is not rulers and authorities that are the people 's masters , it is people who are the true power and those who rule a country are but mere servants of a public responsibility , appointed through the will of the majority . 
the fact that the people 's representatives have the right to make laws and the duty to see that they are enforced is but a transient assignment . 
and in order to guard itself against immoderation , errors or the misuse of power to serve personal interests , democracy has developed principles and laws based on which citizens can hold rulers accountable for what they do . 
such is the law on free access to information of public interest . 
in 2001 , a modern law was passed giving citizens the right to ask and get information on matters of public interest . 
from presidency , government and ministries to the least important civil servant in public institutions , city halls included , they all have an obligation . 
nobody can tell a taxpayer get lost , that 's none of your business . 
but this law should trigger a radical change in both the citizens and the civil servants ' behaviour . 
the former should ask questions , the latter should answer them , in accordance with the law provisions . 
which doesn't actually happen . 
the demonstration recently made by Valerian Stan is eloquent in this respect . 
moreover , I learned that the local council in Turnu Severin town decided to hold their meeting behind closed door , denying press access to their meetings . 
moreover yet , as they enjoy the majority of votes , the ruling power men decided that a councillor representing the opposition be thrown out of the meeting room so that he wouldn't hear what was being discussed and what decisions were being made . 
not to mention other places a cross the country where citizens ask questions about the way public money was spent and they get no answer . 
not to mention the role of the Public Information Ministry which here is working rather like a machinery to produce image strategies than an institution concerned about giving people answers in connection with matters they want to get at the root of . 
at the same time , Romanians still feel they are subordinated to rules and rulers and all they can do is bow to them . 
they have inherited from past times a certain subservient and humble attitude when it comes to authorities . 
instead of holding them accountable , Romanians are more interested in getting in to favour with them . 
it is our duty to tell our readers that , besides their right to support or penalize somebody by means of their vote , they also have the right to be informed and to call authorities to account . 
if they do not exercise this right , they will help their representatives to have their way at the expense of the multitude . 
but if we ask questions and expect answers , in compliance with law provisions , and we close ranks to fight against any deviation from its spirit and letter , then democracy will triumph . 
god only is above all . 
here on earth , citizens are the masters and only then come the rulers , those elected to represent us . 
maybe it would not be amiss for prayers too to undergo some change . 
first we should hear a prayer for the citizens of this country and then for its rulers , if there 's still time and need for it .
