Sunday , 24 February 2002 Moscow is sort of another planet . 
because of the tsars , the communism , the thousands of kilometers that stretch outside it , the muzhik snug at the breast of Mother Russia , the KGB structures , the fabulous riches hidden under the fur of Siberian woods . 
Moscow is the head of the bear untamed for centuries , the world of the millionaires in dollars mixed with the Soviet blocks of flats , of fancy cars lost amongst Volga and Lada cars covered in dust weeping with heavy tears . 
at times , an old and rusty truck cracks on the road and tens , sometimes hundreds of cars wait in line for a miracle to happen . 
the driver sits behind the wheel doing crosswords , insensitive to cold and the dirty snow . 
Moscow is a political pole of the contemporary world where a completely different language is spoken . 
it observes no ideological dogma , it doesn't resemble any form of democracy , it doesn't respond to common stimuli . 
sometimes , it is self - sufficient , other times it joins the world politics only to block it with a firm and final " niet " when you least expect it . 
at the same time , the Russian ruling power lives with an obsession that turns everything silent . 
money . 
in Moscow , a principle can be squashed just like a fly , while efficiency is one step a way from defying the faith in God . 
it 's a world ruled by different rules and language , with different unwritten laws the Romanian politics hasn't been able to get closer to over the last 12 years . 
Russia has been the great fear of the Romanian near and remote past . 
only brave people had the courage to try and do business there . 
many lost and vanished ( some without leaving a trace behind them ) . 
very few managed to survive , by understanding the secrets of the mysterious mechanism of Russian money . 
as for politics , it has worked only as a prejudice . 
Russians seem to smile with lenience to the Romanian democracy . 
the elite in Bucharest have remained with the eyes riveted on the West , without realizing their admiration for the classic democracies are overcharging our bill in favour if Russia . 
Romanians have struggled to get money and credibility in the West , only to eventually pay its huge debt to Moscow , where the supply of natural gas ends in an obsessive " davai " ( " give " - money , of course ) . 
maybe Romania 's drama over the last 12 years has come from not knowing how to deal with Russia . 
it hasn't engaged in dialogue , it hasn't communicated , it hasn't cooperated . 
former prime minister Radu Vasile 's visit to Moscow reduced to an anecdotic - dimension trip . 
the Ribbentrop - Molotov pact , the Romanian treasury and the bilateral treaty have worked like some landmarks on a terrifying border . 
it is only now , after Adrian Nastase 's visit to Moscow , that Romania has come close to understand that the old Soviet style of doing politics no longer exists . 
in the old days , politics would clear the way for economy . 
it would set the targets and the rules . 
and orders would be executed . 
the message of prime minister 's one - day trip to Moscow is simple . 
Russia is carrying on its big - foot politics , as a pole of the contemporary world , with which we only seldom can interfere . 
but the economic partnership is only a matter of communication , delayed for so many years . 
it seems to me that is the most important gain of the 12 hours spent by the Romanian prime minister in the strangest capital city of the contemporary world . 
p . S . Why didn't Adrian Nastase meet with Vladimir Putin ? 
i don't know . 
it 's complicated to answer that question . 
but we could think as well that happened because of Moscow 's hesitation to give a clear answer to the question who 's the main interlocutor in Romania ?
