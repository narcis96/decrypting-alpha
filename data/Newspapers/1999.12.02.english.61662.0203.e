cash - stripped people obviously don't care about those who have money , so much the less if the latter risk to lose it . 
they even may take some pleasure in the latter 's misfortune according to the principle why shouldn ' tthey be as poor as I am ? ! 
since many of our readers probably have no savings they fear to lose , I kindly ask permission to approach an issue that may be of little importance to them , but extremely serious for other people . 
the central bank governor Mugur Isarescu and the Romanian Development Bank president Bogdan Baltazar , both pros in banking matters , speaking about popular banks the day before yesterday said " things are getting hairy " . 
the fact that two top banking figures extremely careful when it comes to statements have raised the red flag is worth focusing on . 
what are " popular banks " ? 
they have been set up under the law 109 / 1996 , one of the last passed by the former parliament under Iliescu 's PDSR rule . 
the law okays the setting up of some " credit co - operatives - popular banks " and regulates the way consumers ' co - operative societies and credit co - operatives should work . 
members of " credit co - operatives - popular banks " pay a monthly installment and from the money raised this way they are disbursed loans at a certain interest rate . 
this crippled law caused Romania to be invaded by all sorts of " petty gliders " . 
they are sort of limited liability companies set up in studios , ground - floor flats , or even houses on some pitted country roads . 
first of all it should be said that these " credit co - operatives - popular banks " are not part of the banking system . 
deposits with these co - operatives are not guaranteed by the state , are not monitored by the central bank and observe no prudence regulations . 
these banks have been set up by mere registration with the Register of Commerce , like any ordinary company . 
these co - operatives will say " brothers , give us your money and we ' ll give you back twice as much in two - month time . 
" moreover , they will disburse one billion worth loans , with the creditor placing his house , or car , or plot of land in security . 
but if the latter fails to pay off his debt , the co - operative can't seize the creditor 's car or plot of land to cover its loss , it just has to take legal action against the debtor . 
and what happens with the other depositors when someone is given their money in loan and then flees the country ? 
god alone knows ! 
perhaps the same thing that happened with money placed in Caritas or Mondoprosper get - rich - quick pyramid schemes . 
who can guarantee that securities issued by these popular banks can be redeemed when they fall due ? 
nobody but God alone ! 
moreover , these small money - making kiosks issue some sort of securities substitute for bonds . 
and interest rates offered by these co - operatives are more attractive than real banks rates . 
in their hunger for money , many people fall victim to this temptation without realizing the danger they expose to . 
credit co - operatives lately have launched some operations that are out of their beat , because there is no legislation to ban them from doing that , and unless forbidden anything is allowed . 
some of these credit co - operatives have started disbursing unemployment benefits , covered by the state . 
it 's as if an important amount of money from the public purse was channelled to its legal destination not through authorized institutions , that is through banks , but through a booth on the city 's outskirts . 
the risk posed by such operations is tremendous . 
i don't want anybody to infer that I ' m an enemy of these small money - spinner factories . 
neither do I have the necessary qualification to assess their operations . 
and as long as their functioning is being regulated by a law , even if crooked and allowing them to do all sorts of financial tricks , their activity is legal . 
legal , but extremely hazardous . 
unofficial statistics put the number of such credit co - operatives between 500 and 1,500 . 
what will happen if one of them caves in and triggers the fall of all the others ? 
who will be responsible for the thousands of people who will lose their savings ? 
the limited liability company at the corner of the street or the parliament in office from 1992 to 1996 ? 
a quake in this field would send people 's confidence in the domestic currency and the bank system further spiralling down , though credit co - operatives are not real banks . 
we Romanians are passionately fond of little flying objects in the financial field . 
and though no fresh companies of the kind can be set up any more , there is the risk to find out that the law 109 / 1996 turned legal lots of Caritas - type get - rich - quick pyramid schemes . 
but much smaller and easier to vanish in the fog . 
this danger should be enough reason to make us look in to the activity of these " petty gliders " . 
over the next days we ' ll go in to the details of these operations and we ' ll provide a picture of this phenomenon hoping the parliament will move in to action to put things in order in this field . 
and they should move fast , as Mugur Isarescu and Bogdan Baltazar said " things are getting hairy " .
