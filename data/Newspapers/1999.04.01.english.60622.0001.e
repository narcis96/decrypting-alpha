till yesterday , Romanians were mere spectators at the conflict in Yugoslavia . 
yet , spirits flared up as if Belgrade were Romania 's capital city . 
every Romanian fellow , unbiased as they are by nature , had a tranchant opinion on the issue . 
NATO is right to teach them a lesson , the Albanians ' rights , genocide , dictator Milosevic , the international public opinion - all these in one dish of the balance . 
and in the other - our Serb brothers , the right to selfdetermination of a sovereign state , the encroachment of principles set down in the United Nations Charter , the NATO transformation from a defensive alliance in to an aggressor , the Albanians are but jerks who want nothing but secession etc. 
people switched from hot debates in parks , press and televisions to rallies in support or against the move , setting American flags on fire , and hurling eggs at Uncle Sam 's embassy . 
president Constantinescu took a quick jump in NATO 's boat , while the leftist oposition winced as if lashed saying this was the worst possible blunder . 
under the circumstances of these mumbo jumbo opinions launched by authorized or ordinary people , the joint session of the parliament the day before yesterday adopted one of the most coherent political statement in the history of our postrevolutionary democracy . 
MPs left aside party bias and group interests enabling thus a realistic stand to be taken on the war that goes on at Romania 's border . 
against the background of this rational official stand , in Bucharest , the communique released by Pentagon yesterday had the effect of a nuclear bomb . 
the fact that the missile that shot down the famous YF - 117 radar - evading bomber was launched from Romania 's territory is equivalent , according to any international law treaty , to a war declaration . 
so , as if the looming nation - wide strike , the decline in the living standard , the domestic currency depreciation and prime minister Radu Vasile 's disease weren't enough , we are now at war with NATO ! 
at the time I write this editorial , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 's reaction hasn't been made public yet . 
but no matter how suble and " understanding " this might be , we have to say it in plain words that at the Washington summit Romania will be pushed down the stairs , at the best . 
faced with a fact of such a gravity , the Romanian authorities reacted in a predictable , totally obtuse manner . 
all we know at the moment is that the damned missile was launched from Jimbolia . 
this triggers a chain of questions . 
was this a political decision ? 
was this action approved by Romania 's Supreme Defence Council ? 
was it a strictly military option , a fact that would be equivalent to an obvious move of disobedience by the military ? 
or is it about a provocation , an action done by some elements infiltrated in the military unit in Jimbolia designed to engage Romania in a conflict it has but to lose from ? 
in case this was a political decision , the fall of the government is imminent . 
Undoubtly , in this case the president had only the support of the opposition parties , which would lead to the formation of a new parliamentary majority by the Democratic Party switching to the opposite side . 
otherwise , it can be but about a decision made by the president on his own , which indirectly implies the institution of a presidential dictatorship . 
if this action has its origin in a purely military option , and the president doesn't do anything , then we can expect a military dictatorship to be instituted . 
we 're talking here of major interests , given the fact that Romania was and still is a gate to armament trafficking . 
finally , the third possibility and the best one , if we may say so , could be that this whole story is but an attempt made by some foreign " agencies " to cause a rift between Romania and the civilized world by the widening of which the long - time wanted ( by some people ) secession be obtained following a pattern which , unfortunately , was used during the second world war . 
a lucid analysis implacably leads us to the conclusion that Romania is in a no - way - out situation . 
if one of the first two alternative is true , then , with all our reserve of optimism , the future of our country as a sovereign and unitary state is compromised . 
the solution can by no means come from the current political class , it will be decided on by the great powers at the negotiation table . 
our only hope is for the third alternative to prove true . 
in this case , it is an absolute must that an investigation commission be set up ( but definitely not a parliamentary commission ) to establish as soon as possible who are guilty for the move and to call them to account in an exemplary manner . 
because nothing would be too much in order to wash out this stain on Romania 's face . 
not even a legislative initiative to amend the Constitution to stipulate the re - introduction of the capital sentence .
