i don't know how many people can understand the man who 's won one million dollars , but is afraid to show up . 
many would say I ' d go and get it in a blink of an eye ! 
it 's not as simple as it looks at a first sight . 
a settled , hard working man with a life well thought - out can't instantly shift to a different world and feel like a lord just because he gets 25 billion lei overnight ! 
probably not all people participating in the bingo or other gambling games fantasize about a life - saving windfall to help them leave behind the uptown neighbourhoods and the hard work and move right in the heart of the high society to start a life of leisure . 
probably for many people gambling is just a pastime , or they play in an attempt to put their destiny to test or to see what taking risks means . 
those who desperately dream of winning fabulous fortunes don't realize they are looking for it . 
and if they win , their joy is so hard to live with that often it ends up by making them miserable . 
in fact , you can't know to what extent such a spell of good luck was given to you as a destiny 's way to chose a victim . 
could it really be so , man ? 
i ' d know what to do with all that money . 
i ' d spend it wisely . 
how wisely , as long as the million dollars has never come your way ? 
the science to manage such an amount is equal to the ability to produce it . 
the fun comes from the fact that all those who can make one million dollars have no time for gambling . 
or if they have some spare time , they ' d rather chose to relax by looking far in to the horizon instead of buying lottery cards . 
why ? 
because such an occupation seems to them a cheap modality of making money . 
if they were to make money from a business , as well as by playing gambling games such as lottery or bingo they would only bring upon themselves the other people 's curses and swear words . 
and that 's the last thing they need ! 
i don't intend to pity those who see gambles as their only chance to make some money . 
nor do I say that some , not as many as expecting it , won't get important prizes . 
Likewise , I don't want to diminish in any way the credibility of the institutions staging these games . 
my feeling is that the number of people hoping to make lots of money from various gambling games is much higher than the number of people convinced thay can produce it and who really set to work . 
any game means a chance to win . 
but a small one , equal to that of the other thousands or millions of people participating in the game . 
when it comes to work , what you earn is one hundred percent up to you . 
only that , normally , this one hundred percent chance should be ( and in some places it really is ) related to each individual 's job performance . 
with some people , the one hundred percent chance , that is an absolutely sure chance , represents only one hundred dollars . 
with other people it represents five hundred dollars , or one thousand dollars , or even more . 
work has one more advantage . 
it makes you see how much you can take . 
it never starts by producing lots of money . 
it slowly gets you familiar with the system , it puts you to test every day and a gain the day you cash your paycheck . 
work naturally improves your capacity to manage money , to make the most of it without losing your head . 
and if you go a stray , you will produce less and your earnings will fly just like a bird off a tree branch . 
" money won't bring happiness " says an old saying . This sounds like acquiescence when said by somewone who doesn't have it , and like hypocrisy when said by the lucky guys . 
no matter how you try to put it , it 's almost impossible to convince people lacking money that gambling is not a solution . 
it 's as if forcing them to admit they can't think of any other solution to make money . 
that is , as if asking them to accept their limitations . 
they would only take your attempt as an insult . 
yet , people should be persuaded there is no reason for them to yearn all their life for a lucky number . 
not only will this fail to change their life for the better , it may even destroy it . 
instead of helping them move to a residential neighbourhood , it would drive them to an inferno with no way out . 
some of these people don't realize the yearned for neighbourhoods of wealthy people in Paris , Beverly Hills or any other such place in the world aren't populated by gambling games winners . 
the residents there either inherited those houses or made their money at the labour " lottery " . 
probably the happy winner of the one million dollars doesn't show up because he 's afraid of robbers . 
or maybe he 's aware robbers are the most insignificant threat in comparison to the other dangers a Romanian winning such a great amount of money could be faced with . 
it 's as if the hazard put a time bomb in his arms urging him enjoy it , so much good will make you drop dead !
