there is nothing more beautiful in the world than love ? 
and doesn't can a man do for this ephemeral joy . He crawls , he plays the fool , he climbs a tree , sings at the balconies , breaks windows , cries . 
and he does lots of other things in an infinite series of gestures , which differ from man to man , from couple to couple . 
in a time of transition , love is even more passionate . 
it can reach moments of despair and burns like a smoky petard or it ends up in ordinary marriages . 
who doesn't remember the big efforts made by ProTV to turn Janine Stefan in to a great fashion designer ? 
is she now a name in the fashion industry ? 
when an entire media trust worked on that , the results were obvious . 
and the love affair ended up in a marriage . 
we should expect the same when we see the media offensive launched by Mihaela Radulescu . 
the more are the shows of the former ProTV star watched by her friends only , the more numerous are stories about her in the magazines . 
that she did this and that , that she bought this and that , she said this and that . 
some magazines , which are given special attention , do not even consider appearing without a photo of the star with ratings in danger of extinction . 
but what doesn't love do ? 
sometimes it doesn't retreat from the tv screen in to the intimateness of the family . 
it is only a drive for being made famous . Haven't you noticed that Ana Lesko has recently shown her two meter - long legs on the front page of the newspaper for taxi drivers and laundrywomen ? 
every two days , Ana Lesko is " subscribed " to appear in a certain newspaper . 
Irinel Columbeanu is really desperate . 
he cannot find more publications willing to promote the striking beauty whom he reportedly ( newspaper say ) bought in a bar at the seaside ! 
the little Romanian rich man wants glory for his love . 
only this way , in the public eye and stirring up the envy of her rivals , he feels a sort of little winged horse ! 
haven't you seen Cristiana Raduta in the video of her " Amour amour " song ? 
at a certain time , on Prima tv station , Cristiana Raduta and her " Amour amour " could be seen more frequently and with less clothes on than the little hen in the commercial of the Knorr soup . 
we don't know whether Ana Lesko and Cristiana Raduta want to eclipse Mihaela Radulescu . 
but it is certain that this Costel Bobic , the businessman of backstage affairs in the past three years of democratic Romania , cannot love in silence . 
if he makes money in the backstage , at least his love should come in to the spotlight , especially because the sensual dance of Cristiana Raduta might drive his opponents crazy . 
if we have a look at the scenery we notice a thing worthy of attention . 
it is a war of villas ! 
moneyed people compete with cars , villas , money - making schemes . 
for some of them all this is not enough . 
they also compete with women , wives , lovers and mistresses . 
and in order to show what they are capable of , they go beyond gifts and arms full of flowers . 
they strongly support them in their careers , they make them rich and they bring them on the public stage , exactly like an ID of wealth and manliness . 
don't laugh . 
the war of love ( in some cases of the mistresses or lovers , in other cases of the wives or girlfriends ) is one of the free shows which have been given to us in this astonishing transition . 
and because you still don't believe me that this is a phenomenon worth noticing , have a short look at the political stage . 
with a magnifying glass and a clod eye try to guess which ones of the hundreds of politicians have pushed their lovers on the path of disputes to flourish in the years to come as reliable beings of this wonderful country !
