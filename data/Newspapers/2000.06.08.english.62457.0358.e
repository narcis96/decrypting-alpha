the FNI mutual fund investors ' protests yesterday looked like the convulsive ringing of a bell staged exactly on the day the International Monetary Fund was to make a decision regarding Romania . 
the protest wasn't staged on Thursday , or Friday , or Saturday , but exactly on the morning of that important day , so that due to the time zone gap the IMF officials could hear the news from Bucharest right before the beginning of their meeting . 
could this protest meeting be just a stupid coincidence ? 
or was there somebody , who had worked hard to drag the Romanian Commercial Bank , and later the popular banks , in the mess caused by the fall of FNI , that thought a supplementary protest meeting staged in Bucharest on Wednesday morning would " help " the agreement with the IMF be postponed ? 
let 's say all are but strange and infelicitous coincidences . 
even planets get lined up from time to time , let alone events ! 
but we could ask ourselves how come the mayors who made available buses to take protesters a cross the country to Bucharest didn't show some wisdom ? 
didn't prime minister Mugur Isarescu say last week that he would personally involve in investigating in to the causes that led to the FNI fall and in the identification of those responsible for it ? 
if memory serves me right , I remember they said the public opinion would be informed on the results of the investigations one of these days . 
wouldn't it have been normal for protesters to wait two or three days more to see what the commission in charge of investigating in to the case would say ? 
maybe the money was found concealed in the safes of a bunch of frauds ! 
or transferred to who knows whose bank accounts ! 
and maybe people could get it back ! 
obviously , I don't believe in such a possibility . 
FNI was but a large - scale scam , a fraud , and those who were behind it made sure to recoup their money . 
the name and the shell is all that 's left of the FNI . 
for the moment , there is no piece of evidence that attempts are being made to hush up the case . 
the head of the capital market regulator CNVM Stefan Boboc was arrested , as well as former Savings Bank president Camenco Petrovici a long with some other figures . 
the list of those who took advantage of the scam still waits to be disclosed . 
and work is under way on this matter , according to promises made by the interior minister . 
obviously , all this can't compensate for the money loss suffered by the FNI investors . 
people are in deep trouble , and the situation has turned desperate for some of them . 
but no matter how many adversities fate has in store for you , one can't overstep the line . 
what am I referring to ? 
the first information on FNI showed the overvaluing of its assets was at the base of the affair . 
putting too much a value on the shares in Industrial Export was the key of the scam . 
lured by that exaggerated raise in the shares ' value , many people rushed to invest their money without wondering whether that raise was possible . 
the fact that the money was guaranteed by the Savings Bank CEC or that FNI was only supported by the CEC doesn't make the affair any dirtier or cleaner . 
it 's just a scam . 
among the first things we learned about after the outbreak of the FNI scandal was that each trust unit had been overestimated . 
considering this , I don't understand why FNI investors claim to be reimbursed the money at this fake value level . 
only because they dreamed of getting as much money as they were deceptively promised ? 
and why should the rest of the taxpayers who didn't invest as they were aware of the risks implied by such mutual funds ( which are very much like the get - rich - quick pyramid investment scheme Caritas ) contribute money to compensate FNI investors for their lost money at the misleading level they had been promised ? 
no penny more or less . 
i don't mean to add to the bitterness of FNI deceived investors . 
on the other hand , we can't come to the front and encourage them in their wish to fight for their rights . 
and they can't be encouraged in a move that makes no sense and is in breach of the law . 
nor can I understand their appeal yesterday as they were gathered outside the government seat when they called on all " honest Romanian generals with the Interior Minister , the Intelligence Service and the Defence Minister to side with the people and don't let themselves be dragged in a civil war . 
" what are the generals and colonels ( who were not involved in the setting up of the FNI ) supposed to do ? 
to side with the FNI investors and attack the government , the parliament and the presidency ? 
to hold the rulers at gun - point forcing them to pay back the sums promised by some illusion trader ? 
the call on the generals sounds really bad . 
not to speak about the law and the order ! 
that gentleman who yesterday was walking a cross the Piata Victoriei * telling protesters yet another bank would fall today was calling on the generals and colonels not because he was afraid we would end up in the situation Albania was some years ago . 
he rather seemed looking for trouble !
