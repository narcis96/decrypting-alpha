Hungarian students should be taught the Romanian geography in the Romanian language , " Mon Jardin " should be translated " Gradinita mea " ( " My garden " ) and " Unirea Shopping Center " - " Centrul Comercial Unirea " for uncle Gheorghe to understand the words ( though he is an illiterate ) , testimony should be given in favour of Slobodan Milosevic before the court in the Hague , and the national anthem should be shortened and changed . 
i quoted some of the political - intellectual and patriotic productions fathered by George Pruteanu and Adrian Paunescu , two migrators who landed in PSD ruling party out of exclusively " spiritual reasons " ( you know what I mean ) . 
the former is outraged that a store sign reads " shop " ( in English ) , and the latter , based on the things his mother taught him , is desperate because the anthem is no longer played , it 's played out of tune , is too long and the nation could be forced " to sing it in E minor " . 
they find some pretext likely to strike a cord with the poor in spirit and the ignorant , turn it in to a matter of life and death and try to draw the country , the parliament , the press and finally the Romanian nation in to it . 
they put all that Romanians hold dearest in the same pot , make a passionate and patriotic dressing which they pour over and come forward shouting at the top of their lungs : attempt against the Romanian language , attempt against uncle Gheorghe , attempt against the national anthem , attempt against the freedom of the press , attempt against Milosevic 's justice . 
then Corneliu Vadim Tudor with his double bass pops up from behind the green trees making such a roaring noise that you could believe the country was going to break in to pieces and the slaves were fleeing it taking our assets abroad . 
this show repeats in compliance with all the rules of a theatrical season . 
as if it were part of a cultural - educational programme set out by the Social Democratic Party . 
because what other reason could make a parliamentary majority in its entirety and a single - party government look at them like stuck pigs ? 
they either were brought up together in the spirit of " Cintarea Romaniei " ( approx . " Song of praise to Romania " )   literary - artistic shows or , as little sun - flower - seeds - crackers , they chanted a long with Adrian Paunescu , in the days of Flacara literary club , the famous " Great country / Great leader " bellow . 
don't laugh ! 
this show , judged from the point of view of the ruling party , is solemn , serious , patriotic , responsible and often loved by the multitude . 
let the country see that Pat , Patachon and the party they stand for have major concerns . 
they are trembling with care for the country and the nation . 
and if possible , in order to make them publicly known , they both should be entrusted with shows ( funded , of course ) on TV and radio stations . 
why do Pat and Patachon make the nation burst in to a bitter laugh ? 
because they pretend not to see the harsh reality that stretches between illiteracy and poverty , ignorance and disappointment . 
pat and Patachon are always uncovering imaginary enemies so as to prevent the population from identifying the real causes of evil and the guilty persons . 
they can't understand that Romanians have come to mumble the anthem or not sing it at all because of their dirt low wages , because of poverty , because of corruption . 
pat and Patachon are trying to fool Romanians saying that if the store signs are translated in to Romanians , if OTV resumes broadcasting , if Milosevic is defended by Ceausescu 's minstrel , if the national anthem is sung to them even when they open their refrigerators , then surely the wellbeing will suddenly set in , without PSD having to make any   effort whatsoever , and the over - wellbeing will flow out through their eyes , noses and ears .
