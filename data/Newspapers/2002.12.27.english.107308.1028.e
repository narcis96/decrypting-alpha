the country has been covered with snow like in ancient fairy tales , and now it looks like a bride . 
carols can be heard on the radio and people bustle about in a holiday atmosphere . 
what is beyond the snow making the fields and the trees look magnificent ? 
for each of us , the appearances of joy hide each day 's fangs of a hungry wolf . 
a bread , a road , a thought , some money , a job , a destiny . 
beyond the magnificence of snow there is the eternal country , with its peasants who are not changed even by the melting of the snow , or by political turmoils , or by European aspirations . 
their hearts are touched only by major sentences and simple judgements . 
they carry in their blood an intangible Romania , mysterious , inertial , eternal . 
from time to time , through snow drifts as high as their houses , groups of carollers sometimes go to towns . 
they look as if they came down from the sky , wearing their clothes of albescent saints , with black caps and long clubs in which they hide plum brandy , they sing outside our windows about everything we dream about but cannot touch , reminding us that they are our identity card , our birth and death certificates . 
not long ago , at Nottara Theatre in Bucharest , I saw " Morosenii from Hoteni " carollers wearing peasant sandals , with tight peasant trousers and short , close - fitting , sleeveless jackets , reminding Bucharest residents that the country was somewhere outside the capital city 's borders , somewhere in the mountains and villages , and that she came to us to ease our sufferings . 
and it is only by returning to it we can find our real selves . 
i listened to Ionu of Grigore , also called Salisteanu , also called Paganini , a virtuoso of the very few we still got left . 
he was playing together with Serban Lupu , maybe the greatest pianist and violinist in Romania . 
Lupu , the artist of great concert halls , was warming up a violin which was heated up by Ionu of Grigore . 
Serban Lupu and the peasant from Maramures were fighting a duel on strings . 
Ionu of Grigore was wielding the violin on the fiddlestick , was playing it under his knees and on the back of his head , enriching the soul of a great artist . 
i also saw Nicolae Pitis , a shepherd from the mountains of Maramures , with his voice resembling the shouting for the sheep , with his carved wooden musical instruments resembling some weapons to fight against loneliness . 
Iza from Hoteni group came to Bucharest for a few hours , following an invitation extended by Formula As magazine . 
they left home on Sunday night through fog and blizzard . 
they just had to be home for holidays . 
they have never spent them somewhere else . 
what sort of Christmas is that when one cannot see their friends and relatives and sing carols to them outside their windows ? 
" now we will leave and we will come the next year as well if they invite us and still remember us " , said Onuta of Poglon . 
the peasants from Hoteni on Sunday night went back to their fairy tale world , in that intangible Romania of daring and magnificent mountains where they descend from to give us back our identity , our feeling of belonging to this place , of a worry we will never get rid of . 
it is them , the peasants of eternal Romania , who lighten up our lives , who sing carols to us and keep our souls in balance . 
it is them who show us where we came from and where we are going to , which our purpose in life is and which our past , what power drives us ahead and what a huge responsibility is resting on our shoulders .
