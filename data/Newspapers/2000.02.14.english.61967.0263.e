i ' m not talking about late Corneliu Coposu or Ion Ratiu , may God rest them in peace ! 
i ' m talking about living dead politicians rattling like a machine gun . 
they squabble over high offices and money . 
they undermine each other , make up , put spokes in each other 's wheel and split up over all sorts of matters . 
but they 're still dead , though they breath , make speeches and split our ears with their idle talking . 
their promise exist only in their ego - centered confused minds . 
what have we got from the fact that Radu Vasile broke a way with the Christian Democratic Party ? 
or from Viorel Lis resigning from the same party ? 
or from the fact that Adrian Nastase will leave or will stay on in Ion Iliescu 's main opposition party ? 
these things may have some impact at the level of gossips on the Parliament or party hallways . 
but they are a matter of little importance when it comes to Romania . 
politicians ' picking on each other has no relation to time . 
that could as well happen in 1880 , 1912 or 1940 . 
it 's typical to the Romanian style . 
in 2000 , this behaviour typical of low caliber people is a real danger . 
Romanian politicians keep talking thirteen to the dozen and are blind to the essential thing that has occurred in the existence of our country . 
they fail to soak up the fact that in Helsinki in December last year Romania was invited to start EU admission negotiations . 
the start of these negotiations is just a short while off and nothing has changed in our political life . 
though I find no pleasure in it , for the first time I have to admit Silviu Brucan is right . 
Romania is facing a hallmark moment in its history . 
it can't possibly be ignored . 
but instead of realizing what 's going on and adjusting their discourse and programmes to match the occasion , our politicians will stick to their old typical style . 
curses , disclosures , accusations , disputes . 
and nothing about what they have to do in the near future . 
the European Union will shortly validate the country 's medium term development strategy which will have to be enforced as governing programme . 
in this case why should we care about Radu Vasile 's doings , about the fact that the Romanian National Party is under negotiations with the Party of National Romanian Unity or about the fact that Ion Iliescu 's party is trying to go in to an alliance with some other party in order to form the government in case of winning this year 's general elections ? 
all of them will have to comply with the strategy requirements . 
to work out programmes and get as much money from Brussels as possible , to get Romanian legislation in line with the European laws and build up a competitive economic frame . 
over the next years , great politicians won't be those trumpeting their patriotism or showing exquisite skill in disparaging their opponents . 
great politicians will be those able to get the highest amount of money from Brussels . 
and Brussels won't pour in money based on someone 's word of honour or on some political friendship . 
they will do that provided we have serious economic programmes and a thoroughly built up budget . 
the European Union officials won't be that naive as to disburse money which they may see going down the gutter of group interests in Romania . 
therefore , money will come , but will be channelled to those skilled in handling it . 
the big trouble with Romanian politicians is they haven't got the slightest idea of how the Union works . 
no matter whom of them you may ask , they will all start to stammer and won't be able to say a thing about as little as the institution 's warden , let alone to be able to bring some money to Romania . 
i ' m not sure Romania has currently more than one hundred people reasonably familiar with EU procedures , commissions , officials , regulations and legislation . 
in fact , getting money from Brussels is already faced with a problem . 
the billions of dollars proclaimed to be disbursed to the country this year are still far a way from Romania . 
many projects lack substance , coherence or are simply funny . 
and nobody will rush to bankroll them . 
in Bucharest , money to come from the European Union have triggered squabbles instead of coherent policies . 
what agency should handle the money , what minister to manage it , what can be done to snatch others ' funds . 
fall will find us singing sorrow if we go on this way . 
political parties too are torn a part by petty squabbles . 
the forthcoming elections are all that matters to them . 
none of them have come up with new policies . 
could that be a sign of incompetence or of absolute indifference ? 
our gut reaction is to label Romanian politicians as incompetent . 
how are they supposed to talk about a mechanism they can't understand ( which in fact is one of the most complicated in the world ? ) 
how can they possibly set themselves targets when they don't know what the European Union expects from Romania ? 
and as they can't understand a thing of what 's going on in Europe and what has to be done in Brussels they keep rattling on about their old topics . 
and with all the ado created they are nothing but dead politicians . 
which is why the forthcoming election campaign will be the last classic - style political soap opera . 
and perhaps only from then on Romanian high class politicians will be only those competent and skilled at drafting viable projects and get finance from the European Union . 
with all the show , there 's hardly anybody who can do that at present .
