the report presented by prime minister Mugur Isarescu before the parliament was an act of public complaisance . 
the famous American report on the state of the nation became " what we ' ve done in ten months " in its Romanian version . 
Mugur Isarescu couldn't wait until December to present his job report . 
at that time nobody will be interested in it any more . 
and the election scuffle is scheduled for November . 
the only solution for him was to go before the parliament now , when all politicians are making plans . 
which is why we witnessed an unbelievably funny situation . 
the prime minister was accused right by the ruling coalition parties . 
it was them that had nominated the cabinet ministers from their own ranks , it was them who had appointed and dismissed dignitaries , and it was them who blamed the prime minister for the situation they had brought us to . 
the ruling coalition ends thus in a derisory tone worthy of being quoted in an anthology of ridiculous situations . 
it incriminates the very man it brought as a saviour after long insistence . 
and now both the Liberals and the Democrats deny him as if he were a loss . 
the little castle made of matches is slowly going down . 
over the next weeks the government will probably remain in the care of secretaries and of security guards , with all the rest governmental officials focusing on the election campaign , party businesses and interests . 
the government premises will look like the site of a plane crash . 
the thing , that is the government , has become shapeless . 
a tiny bit , a sentence , a response here and there . 
and much suffering ! 
could this government be made to work at full speed ? 
my guess is not . 
as long as Mugur Isarescu couldn't bring his own men and as long as we had to deal with ministers appointed by political parties , he only played the role of a lifeguard . 
only that he was a fearful lifeguard or pilot . 
he wasn't able to keep parties under control , to teach them to know their place and to enforce a coherent behaviour . 
he thought he would be able to survive in the jungle by adopting the attitude of a hare . 
he didn't put his foot down , he didn't wipe the ground with anybody , he didn't show the heads of political parties the door . 
he hopped among them in the hope he wouldn't upset none of them and that he would manage to get something out of a bunch of people who were neither a team , nor an orchestra , a crew or even as little as an obeying flock . 
he failed both to keep the inflation rate under control , and to continue the reform . 
probably now the prime minister realizes he ventured in the hope he would be able to harmonize incompatible characters , conflicting political experiences and antagonistic material interests . 
he couldn't possibly come off cleaner . 
or maybe he could have done it if he had played in a suicidal manner , if he had had steel nerves to help him face this bunch of people . 
but it 's obvious he is not fit for such shocking moves . 
and in addition he had to cope with the handicap of having been proposed by a political force facing an accelerated loss of political capital . 
who was he to rely on , as long as he himself was scared ? 
the raise in exports , the drop in the inflation rate ( not as much as to meet the initially set target ) , the resumption in economic growth ( at a slow pace , just like grass growing ) and the drawing up of the National Strategy for Economic Development are some points scored by the Mugur Isarescu government , but they are not enough to give the voters a clear sensation of economic recovery . 
on the contrary , Mugur Isarescu gave the impression of being hesitant and fearful . 
his hesitation showed both when he accepted to take over the premiership and when he joined the presidential race . 
and it also showed in his attitude towards the FNI mutual fund . 
much too cautious in the face of the " weight " of those involved in the FNI disaster , Mugur Isarescu left everything in the care of other institutions and now he risks to be perceived as one of those responsible for the disaster , being more than loosely connected to the issue . 
the presentation of his report before the parliament was nothing but an exercise of getting it in the neck . 
the fact that he elegantly stopped with his head the blows coming even from his partners can trigger only some admiration exclamations regarding his civil manners . 
but to very many people Mugur Isarescu 's performance before the parliament was the revelation of the fact that the prime minister is not a fighter . 
and if he goes on the same way his chances of success in the presidential elections will imperceptibly diminish . 
politically speaking , the coalition and the governing are over . 
this report is the last leg in a fall that not even in our worst nightmares we imagined would be so sad . 
from now on we ' ll have election campaign only . 
may God have mercy on us !
