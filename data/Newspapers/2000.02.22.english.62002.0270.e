Vlad Ranetescu is 27 years old and lives his life in a wheel chair . 
years ago , a skiing accident as he tried to avoid collision with a kid caused the then higher education student a spine fracture at the bottom of his neck . 
Indolence or maybe unconcern made most of his fellow humans to see him as a " dead " person . 
and though he didn't die , they thought he was lost anyway . 
these judgments kick - started a war waged by Vlad and his mother which should have the effect of a cold shower on all of us . 
Vlad 's story is the very symbol of human condition . 
what is the extreme condition beyond which a man could consider himself defeated ? 
what is the condition that could render a man 's hopes pointless ? 
could quadriplegia or being under intensive care be seen as the point of no return ? 
but many people undergoing such experiences have managed to come back to life ! 
and what if the brain won't acquiesce to such a condition ? 
Mrs Ranetescu who is a design engineer by profession quit her job to devote to her son . 
she assumed the duties of an assistant , nurse , massager , school lectures transcriber , computer copy typist . 
one by one , Vlad 's father , his school mates and family friends joined hands in this hope - giving gamble that seemed doomed to fail . 
they started to carry him to attend school lectures , take his exams or medical tests . 
public officials , professors and doctors showed reluctant at first . 
what 's the point ? , they must have thought . 
but finally they yielded to pressure , probably as they felt embarrassed in the face of relentless persistence . 
later on when they realized Vlad 's extraordinary spiritual strength they started to show commitment to the young man 's cause . 
they started to supply him books , and on bad weather they even took a short trip to Vlad 's home on Logofat Luca Stroici street in Bucharest to allow him to take some exam . 
Vlad proved a remarkable student . 
his intelligence and memory outclassed by far those of his mates . 
he graduated with flying colours and as he lived on a 200,000 lei welfare benefit Vlad considered taking up a job . 
but was could he possibly do ? 
he applied for a translator certificate . 
but he 's got to come over and take his exam , like all other applicants ! 
how can we issue him a certificate if he can't write ? 
and a long war against red tape followed . 
finally , authorities approved his registration as a certified translator after he made the proof of his exquisite qualifications for the job . 
and though still reluctant , authorities issued him the certificate . 
for a year Vlad Ranetescu has been working on translating official documents and he says the job is a piece of cake . 
he also started to translate books in to Romanian . 
one of them about the counter - revolution in Hungary is due out of press soon . 
shortly ago , " Evenimentul zilei " carried an interview with Vlad Ranetescu . 
why do we resume the issue now ? 
because Vlad Ranetescu confined to his wheel chair has forwarded us his first TV programmes review . 
the notes of a man doomed to a life of seclusion who keeps in touch with the world mainly by watching TV . 
and though his notes are the only thing relaying him to the hustle and bustle of life in Romania and the rest of the world , they show no touch of hatred or selfishness . 
he proves a generous man , with a refined sense of irony , and his judgments bear the mark of a noble common sensical character . 
which is why we feel honoured to host in our pages the writing of a fellow colleague with rich knowledge of literature and a willpower that is the measure of a human 's inner beauty . 
as of today , TV programmes will be friendly and critically assessed by new TV reviewer who makes his debut in our today 's issue . 
Vlad Ranetescu owes us nothing . 
he will get paid for his reviews exactly like any other journalist with our daily . 
but besides his wages , Vlad is worthy of enjoying everybody 's respect . 
not because he 's a writer , but because his efforts to get himself a place in his community can help us rediscover ourselves . 
maybe we allowed ourselves to yield way too easy . 
maybe we still have inner resources left to help us not consider ourselves defeated . 
Vlad Ranetescu 's example is a source of courage for all of us . 
and he is the one who can most convincingly quote William Faulkner 's words when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature : " Man will not merely endure : he will prevail " . 
but there is another meaning to running Vlad Ranetescu 's reviews in our newspaper . 
the move stands for a step ahead towards normalcy . 
Disabledpeople so far have been looked upon as a burden or a soap opera topic . 
that is what the whole matter boiled down to . 
they weren't seen as community members with their own rights and entitled to feel the joy of living like everybody else . 
but by overlooking our fellow humans ' handicaps we only shed light on our community infirmity as the sign of our inability to overcome preconceptions . 
we thought we were superior because our bodies were in good heath condition . 
and we raised our luck to the rank of a religion of superior human beings while letting many of our fellows go alone through hell torments . 
we wouldn't consider our duty to lend them a helping hand and streamline authorized institutions ' activity to make it possible for them to live a normal life . 
this attitude shaped the line of thinking of the majority , that is we are in the highest number , which means we are right and our reasoning is faultless . 
and therefore the minority are bound to comply with our standards . 
our willpower to tailor our decisions and thoughts to suit the life of our less fortunate fellow humans is the guarantee that the Romanian society is on its way to normalcy .
