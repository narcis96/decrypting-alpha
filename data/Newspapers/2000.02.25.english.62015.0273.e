despite the fact that Ion Iliescu and his PDSR party are comfortably running first in opinion polls , some signs of irritation are already showing . 
something 's wrong ! 
the main opposition party stands high chances to win the forthcoming elections against the background of deepening poverty and spreading trade unionist protests . 
but despite all this , the Party of Social Democracy in Romania ( PDSR ) which announced that once back in power would cancel all the laws passed by the current rulers , showed its opposition to the laws on restoring properties seized by communists and denounced the NATO bombing on Yugoslavia , is facing one more problem . 
not at home , but abroad . 
in Romania , everybody think PDSR may emerge winner in the polls and shouldn't fall out with the party . 
many even rush towards PDSR in an attempt to sweeten their relationship with the party hoping their life will be more comfortable when PDSR gets in power and Ion Iliescu is president a gain . 
the West though doesn't show very impressed with the opinion polls . 
Italy , Germany , Great Britain and USA give more and more signs that western politicians have reservations about Ion Iliescu 's comeback to power . 
" the danger for Romania to slip back in to an antiwestern political camp by PDSR 's and Mr Ion Iliescu 's comeback to power outclasses the danger posed by economic standstill and the current governing coalition failure . 
" the assertion was made by Emil Hurezeanu , the head of the Romanian language department of Deutsche Welle radio station . 
and it was precisely this assertion that PDSR denounced in a letter to the radio station 's head signed by PDSR executive secretary Corina Cretu . 
she accuses Emil Hurezeanu of " stirring up the fear of PDSR " . 
in Romania there is no such fear as long as PDSR has the lead in opinion polls . 
but the fear of PDSR 's potential comeback to power is fast building up in the West . 
and this fear hasn't come out of the blue , it has been triggered by Ion Iliescu 's contradictory statements . 
many of PDSR leaders ' stands on certain issues were perceived in the West as alarm signals . 
they invited nationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor to one of their meetings , they said they had the same blood type , that they would revise the property laws , that all Tony Blair had said in Bucharest was but empty words and that the current power had betrayed the national interest by supporting NATO during the conflict in Kosovo . 
all the above - mentioned stands turned PDSR in to a popular party at home , but which the European Community finds more and more less reliable . 
Ion Iliescu had no reason to get angry with Emil Hurezeanu ( though he avoided to write the letter himself so that he wouldn't attack the person who used to stand up for him on " Free Europe " radio station in Nicolae Ceausescu 's days ) . 
but what if the whole western world was fearing Romania 's fall back in an antiwestern camp - by Iliescu 's comeback to power - more than the current economic stagnation and the current power 's possible failure ? 
reading Bodo Hombach 's statement on the risks of extremist and populist parties taking over the power shows us the fear voiced by Emil Hurezeanu is being shared by almost all the western circles . 
Bodo Hombach in his statement referring to our country said he had met " responsible politicians " in Romania , who needn't be told what they already know very well . 
he said he had been impressed with the words of Romanian prime minister with whom he had talked several times , with the stands stated by the president , the foreign minister and the transport minister with whom he had talked about the Danube bridge project and infrastructure . 
Hombach voiced his belief that Romania was aware of the fact that personal efforts were what counted most and that people should join these efforts . 
he made it clear EU couldn't relieve people from making important decisions but said he hoped electors would show their sound judgment by voting in " the reformist forces " in the forthcoming polls , that is the political forces who are in favour of regional cooperation , the peaceful settling of conflicts and who have no intention to spark and fuel ethnical conflicts , but on the contrary will try to extinguish them by promoting fair and equitable policies . 
Hombach also said the European Union and the G - 8 most industrialized states would provide financial support in order to see the projects envisaged for Southeastern Europe materialize . 
Bodo Hombach is a German politician of high caliber and the special coordinator of EU 's Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe . 
what have you made of his words ? 
do they seem to carry any hint that the West will be happy to see PDSR win the elections ? 
on the contrary , it 's obvious the West refuses to play the game with Iliescu as president on the cards for fear that PDSR 's coming back to power may cause Romania to slip back in to the antiwestern political camp . 
there is growing fear of Ion Iliescu in the West . 
and that fear was triggered by the fact that Ion Iliescu and PDSR haven't been able so far to shape a political discourse and programme to enjoy credibility in the West . 
which could get Romania in to big trouble !
