i have nothing more to say about Romania 's being invited to join NATO . 
nearly all that was to be said was said or written about these days . 
all telling comparisons have been made . 
Whilst Prague looks deserted , at least the places I went to , in Bucharest people showed their enthusiasm in spontaneous meetings . 
and so did people in the provinces . 
but we also had formal meetings staged for people to show their joy . 
Romanians also rejoiced in Alba Iulia , on December 1 , 1918 . 
the country was reunified on that day . 
now is becomes reunified once a gain , nailing down the then accomplishment . 
Romania has taken one more step towards the unification of the European democratic world . 
what did the Reunification on December 1 , 1918 mean , starting as of the following day ? 
a better life ? 
more money ? 
a whiter bread ? 
the peasants who on that day rejoiced like   kids over Romania 's reunification went back to their hardships the next morning . 
and so did town inhabitants . 
they were a whole only in their souls , but they were faced with the same troubles . 
the same holds true now . 
tomorrow we will watch and listen to the president of the United States . 
we will understand this sign of confidence in Romania . 
but as of Monday we will go back to our work . 
the same wages . 
the same cold flats , the same high cost of life . 
disappointments could be terrible . 
pains could be equally awful . 
actually , on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday we ' ll discover nothing has changed in our annoying daily life . 
but despite all this , things are not the same as before . 
there 's a different horizon . 
there 's hope . 
there 's a chance . 
and an assumed obligation . 
we have to cover faster a road that leads to better days . 
how ? 
the same hem and haw way ? 
i don't think so . 
we ' ll burn our fingers if Romanians in the following weeks can't say that something has changed in the attitude of puffed up politicians , in the arrogance of civil servants , in the justice tricked in to letting the mighty get a way with their wrong doings . 
Romanians will get angry . 
not because after the invitation to join NATO they won't get one more bread loaf . 
they will get angry seeing that after the moments of elation things have resumed their sly course . 
that is , everything will go well for the upper crust and bad for the poor . 
and it won't work . 
yesterday 's resounding success will be pushed aside . 
simply ignored . 
and after a victory in Prague , a political catastrophe can follow for those who represented us . 
a grey and frowned country could follow after a country draped in the blue of the invitation to join NATO . 
undoubtedly , after the passionate speeches , people are expecting more from politicians , without understanding they too have to make some changes . 
it 's about old habits , the " never mind , it will work anyway " mentality , swindles , arrangements , the whine not always followed by action . 
Voronet blue and NATO blue are beautiful when we don't see blue with hunger and red with rage . 
laws above politicians , not at their beck and call , roads , telecommunications , money fairly spent , viable and simple institutions , civic spirit ( some of us , for instance , have a problem and we get organized to fight for it and get it solved ) , care for the land we are travelling through times . 
that 's pretty much what we need . 
and gee , what a country we would have then ! 
and how beautiful that NATO blue could look ! 
just like the Voronet blue .
