god never uses the rod to discipline people . 
he 's lenient , He pretends He doesn't see your wrongdoing , He forgives you over and over a gain , till one day when He says to Himself : the world 's order will turn in to mess if I stay idle . 
when it came to the debate on the priests ' collaboration with the former political police and the examination of their Securitate files , He sit on the fence and let us do the quarrel . 
he wanted to see whether we were able to find the right way back to normality or we chose to go on lying and hiding the truth . 
and the officials of the Romanian Orthodox Church ( BOR ) turned the matter on both sides , and examined it thoroughly , and thought it over and finally persuaded both Ion Iliescu and the MPs that it would be a bad thing for the nation to learn about the unforgivable sins committed by some priests in the communist years . 
and with support from the country 's rulers , despite many Romanians ' opposition to the move , BOR maculated the law altering its meaning and preaching fictitious truths . 
to put it in plain words , they left the issue of some priests ' guilt unclarified . 
and the mass of believers got tired and gave up on their wish to see the matter set right . 
god said O . K . , let 's see if things work the way the Romanian Orthodox Church wants ! 
but he didn't fall asleep . 
he sent the clergy another challenge to face . 
he allowed stories about some churchmen committing fornication with seminary students to come to the knowledge of public opinion . 
and it 's not the first time this happens . 
for years and years , the press has reported on priests engaged in sexual relations with adult or young men and about monks coveting the bodies of their monastic fellows . 
and maybe God said about Teodosie Snagoveanul * well , maybe I will forgive you for what you said about the priests ' ties with the political police and about their Securitate files . 
but I won't forgive gay love . 
first of all , because it 's a matter of hypocrisy . 
before your parishioners , you condemn the love between man and man , but in secret , in your cells or in your homes you indulge in disgraceful lust . 
that 's why I will let the press report news after news about your deeds . 
and so , the true character of one of our Church 's favourites involved in the battle for a higher office in the clergy hierarchy was exposed before his fellow humans . 
and Patriarch Teoctist , under the pressure of public opinion , announced the dismissal of Cernica Monastery 's superior and principal of the High School Seminary . 
if the high officials of the Romanian Orthodox Church , fierce adversaries of journalists who want to find out the truth , do not believe in the power of the public opinion , then they surely trust God . 
and maybe He made the debauchery to come to light , sending the entire Church a sign the cleanup time has come . 
meaning that He too no longer likes the seminary teachers taking bribe to facilitate some candidates ' admission to the seminary or getting " fees " for helping them to pass their exams . 
nor does He like appointments to parish offices based on gifts such as calves and money , instead of faith and love for your fellow humans . 
nor does He like sexual debauchery , the taking part with the rulers in wrongdoing , the dirty handling of money in order to get rich by dishonest means , the harassment of laymen 's wives , hard drinking , greed , putting the screw on parishioners on the occasion of wedding or funeral ceremonies just out of money hunger . 
in this page corner I wonder whether the exposure of fornication committed by superior Clement Popescu , a person close to the Patriarch , could be a sign sent by God that the Romanian Orthodox Church , of its own accord and will , should start a campaign to clean itself up of the sinners in church garments who defile both the religious belief and the altar .
