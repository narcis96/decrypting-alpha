it 's for the first time after 1989 that electoral posters outnumber stray dogs . 
you can see more pictures of candidates for Bucharest mayor than cats , litter bins or ornamental plants . 
life gets flooded with politics and stories connected to it . 
newspapers carry all sorts of pictures kept under wraps so far and brought to light at the right time . 
some of them have the impact of a terrible blow on the fontanelle . 
in Bistrita , the president of the Democratic Party town local was presented to the public opinion in the same sweet but unbecoming posture like the prosecutors in Craiova city . 
Costea affair too has about it some election connotations . 
actually , the election campaign consists in a stock taking operation and a profusion of offers for the future . 
but taking stock of the past refers to both what politicians did for the show , that is for the community , and to what they did for their personal lives . 
obviously , all of them would show a freshly built bridge , an upgraded sewage system , a refit sidewalk section , a newly unveiled statue , as they think dirty disclosures are not typical of their activity and are nothing but fabrications devised by their enemies . 
but paying for dirty affairs is part of the stock taking at the end of a term in office . 
therefore , all sorts of scandals will surely break out throughout the country . 
at a first sight we could say this happens because of the high stakes in the election competition . 
but election scandals are not typical of the Romanian political life . 
they will shake the political stage in the USA , France , Germany , Italy and the U . K . too . 
and he will be driven out of the race who 's caught red - handed . 
in other places around the world , a candidate will be dismissed over petty illegalities . 
but we are much more " tolerant " in this respect . 
we won't fly off the handle even if learning about horrifying things or crass illegalities . 
we will rather wonder and then make fun of the whole thing . 
we simply aren't as merciless as voters in other places . 
we will punish them by making fun of things rather than by the way we vote . 
but these election disclosures should teach the Romanian politician something . 
They should teach him that he can't afford doing anything he pleases . 
that he may be a big shot for a while , but everything he does is recorded somewhere and the time will come when he ' ll have to account for what he 's done . 
this is the least Romanian politicians should keep in mind . 
only then will we have small - time or big - time politicians , mayors , and ministers who fearing potential scandals will be aware of having to account for their doings at a certain moment . 
what was the Democrat in Bistrita thinking , that he could show his true colours and nobody would see him ? 
what was George Padure thinking , that he could raise money to set up a store chain and nobody would ask him what he did with the money ? 
and George Pascu , Ion Iliescu 's treasurer during 1996 election campaign , what was he thinking , that nobody would rummage through the records looking for the customs papers ? 
and Viorel Lis , wasn't he aware that some day someone would thoroughly look in to all the house distribution papers signed by his secretary ? 
we call all these facts scandals . 
and some are really scandalous facts ! 
but actually this is about payoff time for politicians 's past doings . 
their sordid disappointing aspect left aside , there is a good part to all these things . 
they will teach politicians to fear consequences of their deeds . 
they ' ll teach them the rules of democracy . 
as long as they are in power , they can move unrestricted in their little square marked out by laws . 
but they learn that as soon as they step a cross its borders they will run the risk of being reprimanded , taken pictures of , and thrown behind the bars . 
many of the illegalities committed by the people 's elect haven't surfaced yet . 
some may never come to light . 
but most of them make the headlines during election campaigns . 
what kind of life is that when you know that some terribly wrong thing you did hasn't come to light yet ? 
you get up in the morning and go to get your newspaper wondering whether what you did has finally come to light or not . 
if it hasn't you heave a sigh of relief and enjoy another peaceful day . 
but what about the next day ? 
how many weeks or months could you cope with the thought that a scandal may break any time now to expose you to ridicule ? 
one should either have nerves of steel or be completely irresponsible to live like that . 
their moral sordidness left aside , the election scandals also have a healing and prophylactic function . 
it 's like that childhood game whose final purpose was blame assigning .
