nobody knows how the money allotted to promote Romania 's image abroad is spent . 
nor of what use are all sorts of promotion operations . 
but undoubtedly three quarters of the measures in the Nastase government 's NATO admission programme can bring us more credibility than all the concerts and symposiums put together . 
and they may cost us a little less . 
if we pore over NATO 's requirements and the executive 's programme , we will be surprised to discover things are not that hard to do . 
the chapter on the military restructuring is an exception . 
this calls for money , job cuts , missions and projects carrying out . 
all that can't be done in a flash . 
but all the other chapters sound " humanly " . 
the plan stipulates a law on high officials declaration of wealth . 
well , Romanians require that too . 
they want to know how rich our elected are when they take and leave office so that transparency force them to put themselves muzzles . 
the law we are talking about costs nothing except for some workdays / parliament plus some good faith . 
a law on the conflict of interests . 
isn't that what voters , the press and Traian Basescu are demanding ( though the latter seems to forget he too was a shareholder ) ? 
a civil servant behaviour code . 
what , it that a bad thing ? 
or was it hard to make ? 
two jurists , three experts and four dignitaries can develop a bill in two afternoons . 
or the law on political parties financing . 
hasn't that been a problem for so many years ? 
isn't the current way of financing political parties one of the main causes leading to dirty money , frauds and compensatory appointments to high offices ? 
did we have to wait till the very last moment ? 
it 's simply incredible that we ' ve wasted so much time without realizing that even if we didn't want to join NATO we still would need a law to enable business communities to be consulted and get involved in decisions that concern them . 
haven't we had enough of stupid decisions made by all sorts of ministries and sometimes even by the parliament ? 
not even the setting up of a single contact office for foreign investors is a novelty . 
Emil Constantinescu appointed an ombudsman , an institution that came to nothing just like the single company registration office ( now it takes you twice the time needed before to have a company registrated ) . 
is it that difficult to work out the problems plaguing the children adoption legislation ? 
can you imagine we don't have a prosecutor representing Romania to work with the European SECI Center ? 
Thit seems a matter more complicated than the appointment of a new Constanta county prefect ( the office has been vacant for some months and all political parties are struggling to have their own man appointed ) . 
but SECI Center is in Bucharest and all it takes is a piece of paper with a few lines written on it and signed by a minister plus an envelope with a stamp on it . 
reading all this you feel like asking yourself why on earth haven't we done all these things by now ? 
why have we wasted time on less important things ? 
why haven't the state institutions drafted these bills by now ? 
and why hasn't the legislative " malaxator " , now in fourth gear , mixed them too in to the legislation body ? 
if till the fall we are able to tick off all the laws that do not need money , but only workdays / government and parliament , then we ' ll really have reasons to say we are making progress in the process of Euro - Atlantic integration . 
but we won't be able to answer a very simple question . 
what the hell have we been doing so far and whose uncle Antony have we been helping to kill dead mice ?
