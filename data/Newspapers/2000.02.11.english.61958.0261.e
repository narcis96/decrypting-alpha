you 're picking on us , man ? ! 
why do Romanians view MPs with an unfriendly eye ? 
because as a rule the latter don't show smarter or more diligent than the rest of the nation . 
they are ordinary people turned public figures after their names got on some lists . 
they haven't got MP seats due to some extra qualities or to their wish to sacrifice themselves for the welfare of the nation . 
the other reason behind ordinary people 's dislike of MPs is the fact that once the rope - long lists bring them in to the spotlight they start to see themselves as the hub of the universe . 
powerful , eternal , wise and committed to the cause ! 
Romanians can't stand MPs because as soon as they get elected they all will behave as if they have been set on a pedestal . 
they don't realize they are but poor passengers in a political train . 
they certainly have some weight , but only as long as their journey lasts . 
as soon as they get off that train , they will resume their anonymous existence and return to being the kind of people you wouldn't notice even if you saw them standing alone in the middle of a road closed to traffic . 
despite all this , Romanian MPs aren't as angry with ordinary people for their bad public image as they are with the mass media . 
they say journalists are behind ordinary people 's bad feelings against them . 
because journalists showed them dozing off during parliamentary sessions , massacring the Romanian language , masterminding dirty affairs , or drawing water to their mill . 
those damned journalists rushed to write about them buying fancy cars , setting up private businesses , handling huge daily allowances , propelling their relatives to high offices or saying God knows what nonsense . 
and what measure did they think to take to clear they image tarnished by those press jerks ? 
they thought to get themselves a mirror to show them exactly how they imagine they are . 
Romanian MP is a self - conceited creature . 
in the morning he will glance at himself in his bathroom mirror or the mirror in the restroom at his office ( provided that 's not broken ) and say just look at me , man , I don't show as silly and bad looking as press say I am . 
this means I am the victim of a diversion . 
a state institution is being disparaged . 
and the easier way to protect myself is for us to create a national mirror so that the nation can see us as we really are , not as we are unfairly presented by journalists . 
consequently , the Senate Standing Bureau approved that legislative debates be broadcast live on as special TV station . 
just like Americans do . 
so that we won't believe any longer the rubbish based on rumours written on them by greenhorn journalists . 
so that we can watch them live , and take delight in the nation 's representatives ' broad thinking and proficiency in Romanian language without the need of mediators . 
the station in question will surely have high audience ratings . 
each and every MP 's wife , mistress , offspring , pig , dog and neighbours will stay glued to the TV to see their county representative taking the floor . 
political parties will also follow debates to see who 's diligent , who 's skipping sessions and who 's secretly plotting with the opposition enemies . 
and as they stand for the Romanian people before God and in democracy books , they have also decided to forbid their surveillance by the Romanian Intelligence Service . 
if the law remains unchanged , it means the parliament is equal to God , as neither of them can be surveilled by the spy agency . 
and what would be the point in doing so as long as the institution is the embodiment of patriotism and moral purity ? ! 
the spy agency should focus on waitresses , tailors , market vendors , company accountants and night wardens . 
they should be suspected of leaking top secrets , not the MPs ! 
as if their patriotic chip was to start buzzing and turn MPs paralysed the moment the thought of leaking some top secret or committing some act of treason crossed their minds . 
as if they were to find their pockets sealed the moment they tried to squeeze in some thousands dollars received for leaking a state secret . 
and why should the government be watched as long as MPs are not ? 
how could we imagine that such things may happen in Romania 's sacred buildings ? 
not to mention the presidential office where such things are quite impossible to happen . 
poor presidency employees live there like in a jar with disinfectant . 
not even bugs can reach them , so much the less greed , cupidity , and treason ideas . 
they are more indifferent to bribery than robots . 
really , why should ordinary people be angry with Romanian MPs ? 
it beats me ! 
i for one see them as ordinary people , even outrageously ordinary , with all their fellow humans weaknesses plus the weaknesses of my pet dogs which try to catch one another unawares to snatch bones .
