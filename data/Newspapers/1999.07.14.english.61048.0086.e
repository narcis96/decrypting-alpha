smart - type secret agent 
( i ) When I first went to Switzerland I acted as a courier , too , for an acquaintance who asked me to take a bottle of strong brandy to an old friend of his . 
i agreed , took the package , made the phone call , met the recipient . 
and when I was handing him over the package with the bottle and two smoked sausages a flash beamed . 
an intelligent - looking old man was taking a picture of me . 
what do you know , he is curious just like a woman , I said to myself while he was taking shots of the lake and the scenery behind us although it was plain to see that he was all ears . 
like any Transylvanian , I only realized this a little later . 
it was the famous Swiss intelligence , and I was only the stinking commy who took any chance to get there , even for a soccer match . 
Fortunately I pulled out the bottle , the sausages , too , and the agent focused his camera on the mountain peaks . 
to me it was clearer than ever that there is always an eye watching me , no matter where I may be on the globe . 
the old man in Switzerland was too conspicuous , too obvious to go unnoticed . 
as time went by , I came to accept that the secret services are part of the game , that any self - respecting state will wisely make use of them to protect its interests and surprisingly checkmate audacious opponents . 
and this is the starting point of a poker game and of a war we don't know very much about and whose actors , papers and strategies will remain secret to us ordinary mortals . 
what if the dioxin - infected chicken is an economic blow struck by a secret service ? 
what if the big Coca - Cola madness is but a very smart concoction to return the Americans an earlier blow ? Or what if this is just a way to respond to the drop in the euro currency ? 
god alone knows the truth , but the certain thing is that manoeuvres of secret services of powerful countries are behind economic wars . 
unlike such states , Romania has been in a most ridiculous position . 
instead of protecting the country , secret services after 1990 have taken part in the country 's pillage . 
they have been pinching here and there and tried to render themselves useful by interfering with politics . 
if we take stock of what has been going on since 1990 , we will see there have been many instances when the Romanian intelligence service SRI was disclosed as interfering with politics and the media . 
for instance , the bugs from under the table fell off during a meeting , wires were found leading a cross attics to other connections , one of their cars was spotted in centre - town . 
the first major problem is that the SRI men are caught in the act as if they were some suckers stealing fruit in the marketplace . 
let 's leave aside the ridiculous side of instances when they were exposed on a surveillance mission nearby a cafe in centre Bucharest or when some dimwit who was inquiring about Mihai Razvan Ungureanu or Horia Patapievici reported on his mission by using his code name . 
these are agent Smart - type stake outs . 
but being caught red - handed by journalists at a cafe , being recorded on tape , having the car spotted in the centre of a town are worrying signs of amateurism . 
this is throwing a spanner in your own works , is like sending a cat with bells around its neck on a mouse chase , it is a decline from performance levels of Ceausescu 's Securitate . 
without being in the least nostalgic for that service that had come to use diabolical procedures , I cannot help noticing a certain decay in professionalism . 
awkward moves , unsubstantiated information , low stake battles and no long - term strategy . 
there are many reasons for this decline , such as the cleansing in recent years , walk out of professionals , fund shortage , tremendous pressure put by everybody to make sure that abusive practices of the former Securitate will never occur . 
it is an utter confusion whose consequences are showing . 
from this viewpoint , the spotting of the SRI car at Odorheiu Secuiesc is prejudicial to the intelligence service . 
first of all , mounting a video camera on a freezer van was a rude method , showing at least lack of imagination . 
surveillance can be conducted by using a video camera mounted in a tiepin or at the spectacles rim . 
switching microphones or the video camera from the bulldozer on the van is some progress , but it is laughable . 
it is like using the slingshot to fight back strikes of a Suhoy 30 or a F 16 . 
but the recording story at Odorheiu Secuiesc is much more complex , as the question raises whether the SRI " bulldozer " had any business being at a public meeting .
