Radu Vasile , if he weren't Romania 's premier , would undoubtedly be one of the candidates with high chances to be ranked among the most congenial persons in the country . 
his appearance is that of a man with no rough edges , who does his best to avoid upsetting anybody , who doesn't care about power and is not money - minded . 
to put it shortly , his appearance is that of a kind man with a heart of gold . 
the bad thing is that Radu Vasile , a congenial person , a jaunty politician and a passionate sports fan , is also Romania 's premier . 
and the fact that he is likable is of some importance , but not decisive where his status of prime - minister is concerned . 
as compared to the duties typical of such a high post , this highly liked trait of character becomes secondary , if not insignificant . 
it isn't a valuable asset , the same way speaking just for the sake of speaking is rather a flower in the buttonhole which subsequently turns in to a weight which pulls you down , that is a drawback . 
tongue wagging renders friendly chats charming , but causes insuperable problems to high office holders . 
the other day Radu Vasile was telling Zoran Djindjic that the government is willing to support Serb opposition to overthrow Milosevic . 
the words which escaped the premier 's lips would take big proportions should the USA ambassador , if not Bill Clinton , state that the Americans are willing to take in to account all political means to overthrow the ruling coalition and Radu Vasile cabinet . 
but the garrulous Romanian politician is best characterized by Radu Vasile himself . 
in his interview with BBC on Sunday , the premier says : " The Romanian politician is by definition very talkative and he will express his opinion about anything " . 
furthermore , exactly on Sunday , when the interview was broadcast , the premier was attending the dedication of the church in Botesti , the native village of PNTCD leader Ion Diaconescu . 
he said during his interview with BBC : " Election period is drawing close and it is sure that certain ministers want to prove their devotion to their party and that they are promoting the party 's interests " . 
if we closely inquire in to these sentences we will realize they also apply to both their author , PNTCD Christian - Democrat Radu Vasile , and to president Emil Constantinescu . 
this must be true , because what other explanation is there for the two attending some church dedication like any other ? 
didn't they consider that their attending now a match or a concerts then services to dedicate churches may result not in electoral gains , but in a depreciated image of their offices , following sort of a public appearance inflation ? 
the premier said some other interesting thing in the above - mentioned interview , namely that he 's had it , that if the press keeps levelling attacks at him , he will get angry and quit the party . 
and in order not to be taken for a big naive , Radu Vasile also says : " I won't say a word about what I have seen while in the cabinet or about my party colleagues , I assure them of this ; they needn't worry , as they may be only mentioned perhaps in my memoirs , if I publish them " . 
this is something new , you must admit that ! 
it is certain that the premier did not threaten with the things noticed while in the cabinet and which are state secrets , as he pledged not to disclose such secrets when he was sworn in . 
so Radu Vasile 's warning cannot be about this . 
then what else did he see while in the cabinet ? 
preferential contracts ? 
posts distributed according to kinship ? 
fraudulent privatisations ? 
fabulous facilities ? 
and it isn't even about the Liberals or about Petre Roman 's PD Democrats . 
it is about the Christian - Democrats . 
and judging by the premier 's words we understand that his distinguished party colleagues did after all do something extremely serious which makes them squirm in their sleep . 
but Radu Vasile is generous , they needn't worry as he won't say a word about it . 
he may eventually disclose something in his memoirs , when they cannot be held responsible . 
these sentences from the BBC broadcast interview really set us thinking . 
what is that Radu Vasile saw and is so serious that could get the Christian - Democrats in big trouble ? 
and if it is so serious , why does the premier keep mum ? 
only out of loyalty to the party ? 
isn't it the duty of the government he is heading to make sure law is observed ? 
and if some people broke the law , the only condition they should meet for the premier to say " I won't say a word about what I have seen while in the cabinet " is to be his party colleagues . 
and if it isn't about things that are in breach of the law , then why won't he name them ? 
A response from the PNTCD to the premier 's gesture is not out of the question . 
his party colleagues may retort that they won't say a word about what they saw in the cabinet or they may take the premier 's statement as a threat and get even when the time is right . 
" the Romanian politician is by definition very talkative and he will express his opinion about anything " . 
Radu Vasile 's statement goes for Radu Vasile himself .
