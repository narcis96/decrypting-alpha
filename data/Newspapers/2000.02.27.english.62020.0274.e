the warrant for the arrest of Bucharest 4 th district mayor Marin Lutu came as a surprise to lots of people . 
it 's the first time such a thing occurs over the last ten years . 
no party has ever before taken tough measures against a reliable member who had been serving the cause of his political group by expelling him first from the party 's Standing Delegation , then from the party ranks and finally see that man remanded in to police custody . 
ordinary people might say the move caught them unawares . 
the fact that the Christian Democrats approached the issue in a thoroughly manner gave the impression they were just trying to buy time . 
this Marin Lutu who 's sort of a political pygmy was one step a way from becoming the symbol of evil . 
when Bucharest residents heard the man would not resign his office they said to themselves well , the man probably served a lot of people , he knows about a great deal of dirty affairs and can afford standing up to them . 
there is nothing they can do against him . 
so why should you , a man burdened with hardships , cudgel your brains about the matter ? 
there 's no chance you can do anything . 
the IRS , police and sanitation inspection are all over you . 
you grease everybody 's hands and all you get is hard work . 
if you really want to rise in the world , you ' ll have to hook up to the political life . 
you ' ll get a slice in the cake , share some of it with others , but you ' ll still be left with enough of it . 
your grand - grand children won't have to worry about tomorrow . 
the law will always be on your side and as far as parties are concerned , they are all the same . 
they lure the hungry to join their ranks , they allow them to stuff their pockets and stand by them through thin and thick . 
all they do is share the cake in a " democratic " manner . 
ordinary people and public welfare are but pretexts , topics for TV chat shows and pompous interviews . 
that 's all ! 
that 's what we used to think and for a while longer till others of Marin Lutu 's kind get what they deserve we ' ll still be tempted to think this is the normal way for things to happen . 
nevertheless , Marin Lutu 's arrest is a great victory . 
he 's the first client of the ruling power arrested in accordance with democracy principles . 
mass media reacted to alarm signals sounded by people . 
it 's pointless to say how many weeks " Evenimentul zilei " strove to draw attention on the series of lawbreaking cases occurred in the capital city 's fouth district . 
at a certain moment , our journalist assigned for this investigative report was even threatened by some Lutu family member that she might just have a car accident . 
the wronged retailers in illegally privatised open markets in their turn plucked up courage . 
other newspapers and TV stations joined our disclosing campaign . 
the storm raised was so powerful that finally the Christian Democratic Party ( PNTCD ) yielded under pressure . 
Christian Democrats were forced in to looking in to the case , ask Marin Lutu to resign the party and request the authorized state institutions take over the case . 
when we heard that Marin Lutu was discharged from hospital and going back to his office we felt as if the sky was falling on us . 
we felt the scores of press reports and the month - long investigations proved nothing but how powerlessness and ridiculous we were . 
it was only on Wednesday that what at first was just a " press scandal " assumed the proportions of a political scandal and under the pressure by public opinion the case came to its end : Marin Lutu got arrested . 
his arrest is not only the end put to some absurd sort of behaviour , but also the clampdown on the idea that any dirty politician can get a way with whatever he may do if he 's a big shot in the governing party . 
this victory makes ordinary people start realizing their power . 
it makes them see they are important not only when they go to the polls , but also when they refuse to put up with corrupt practices . 
they can make it happen that any self - styled big shot , no matter how glued to his chair , can be forced out of office like any ordinary man and sent before court to account for his deeds . 
Marin Lutu case is also a journalistic victory . 
it denies the long - lived saying the dogs bark , but the caravan goes on . 
now we have the proof not everything goes on and some evil things can be stopped . 
but Marin Lutu 's arrest is above all the Christian Democrats ' victory . 
many of them , especially members of low caliber seeking benefits from their party membership , will get the creeps : what if this will happen to us ? 
and Marin Lutu 's " career " will make many of them think twice before attempting to line their pockets from the public purse . 
and people who see politics as a get - rich - quick way will also have to keep in mind this story . 
but it is the electors who will gain most . 
unfortunately , Marin Lutu scandal came a little too late . 
had 4 th district city councillors informed earlier on their boss ' misuse of authority and had PNTCD initiated the operation launched by the press , undoubtedly the Christian Democrats ' current position would have been far better . 
their message to the party and voters would have spared them being labelled " they are no better than the other parties " and would have caused the first great revolution in the politicians ' conduct . 
Marin Lutu 's exposure could remain an isolated case . 
and Romanians have a saying : " One swallow does not make a summer . " 
but PNTCD ' sratings will surely go up if they approach all potential future fraud cases in the same firm way they did in Marin Lutu 's case . 
they are not very good at economic matters , but at least they teach crooks to know their place , ordinary people will say . 
logically speaking , Christian Democrats stand no chance to gain back the ground lost over the last three years . 
but they will win back some ground and wash a way many of their sins if they go on cleaning up the party of people like Marin Lutu . 
if extended , the cleaning up operation started with Marin Lutu might strike a chord with many Romanians fed up with frauds and swindlers .
