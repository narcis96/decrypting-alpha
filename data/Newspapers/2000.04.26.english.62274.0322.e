i ' m not sure whether you remember to whom George Padure gave his votes in the Bucharest local poll in October 1998 . 
he certainly didn't support Viorel Lis ! 
at that time , he urged his followers to support Sorin Oprescu from Ion Iliescu 's PDSR in the second ballot of the race for general mayor . 
has George Padure ever been a Liberal ? 
not at all ! 
ever since Ceausescu 's days when he returned home as a tourism guide and agent for a seaside foreign company he 's been making friends with everybody . 
with Dinamo and the police , with the power and the opposition . 
as a mayor , he distinguished himself only by having the stalls removed from Magheru Boulevard and by his fussy attempted resignation from his office as Bucharest 1 st district mayor . 
only few people know that at that time George Padure went in tears to Victor Ciorbea to ask him not to approve his resignation , and that he tried his luck with several parties in the hope he would be gladly accepted as member and supported . 
and as nobody else accepted him , he joined the Liberal Party . 
i won't dwell on the GEPA subject , that is the teeny bit of his businessman image he 's been left with . 
George Padure is not today 's topic . 
which is why we will pass to another town and another incidental Liberal . 
it 's about Lucian Iliescu , the man in Giurgiu booed by his fellow citizens after Ceausescu 's fall . 
later on , Lucian Iliescu became one of the Labour Socialist Party 's outstanding figures . 
things were going swimmingly for the man . 
Iliescu became a businessman and the mayor of Giurgiu town , while he was involved in all sorts of shady affairs . 
his son was suspected of being involved in stolen cars trafficking , while the relationship between the mayor of Giurgiu town and the traffic police head Colonel Soricica was notorious . 
moreover , the two are partners in a company . 
and you guessed the answer if you figured out Lucian Iliescu had become a Liberal and would run a gain for the mayor of Giurgiu town . 
here 's another case . 
as I mention the name of Constantin Sofroni from Suceava , I assume readers will quickly realize that after being a member of several parties , he finally joined the National Liberal Party and he is to run for the mayor of Suceava town . 
at the beginning , Constantin Sofroni was a member of the Front of National Salvation , he got a prefecture office , then migrated to the Ecologist Movement in Romania , and after A few years he joined the Agrarian Party and ran in elections on the party 's slate to become the Suceava mayor . 
but his political voyage wasn't over yet . 
Constantin Sofroni joined the Romanian 's Alternative Party , turned the Rightist Forces Union , but he stuck with the party only for a short while as today Sofroni is a Liberal and will run in the polls on the National Liberal Party 's ticket . 
we don't know how many other such candidates are on the Liberal Party 's lists for the local elections . 
it would be unfair to claim this phenomenon is typical of the Liberal Party alone . 
other parties are certainly faced with similar cases . 
but we find the above - mentioned examples intriguing . 
didn't the Liberals have another candidate for the Bucharest mayoralty ? 
because the party doesn't seem to lack outstanding figures ! 
it even has a lot of important and credible members not dented by " impaired " businesses or resorting to " crocodile tears manoeuvres " who could have been a gain for Bucharest . 
weren't the Liberals able to find some other candidates to run for mayor in Giurgiu and Suceava ? 
are they so desperately eager to win a mayor seat that they were willing to promote overnight all the high offices hunters and migrators ? 
did the Liberal need as a candidate a man who 's deep in debt to the Agency for Recouping Banking Assets ( George Padure owes AVAB 1 . 5 million dollars , which is why his GEPA CENTER will be turned in to a bank head office and the rent money will go to AVAB . 
so much for GEPA CENTER , " a little better for you " ! 
) what else would be the Liberal Party capable to do in order to win a mayor seat ? 
the three above - mentioned candidates show us the Liberal Party is ready to throw anybody in the local election race in order to win . 
will they really win by making use of people with certain opinion poll ratings ? 
PDSR made the same huge mistake when choosing innocent former excellent tennis player Ilie Nastase to run for Bucharest mayor . 
the party imagined Ilie Nastase 's well reputed name would be able to bring them the victory in the local polls . 
the Liberals ' policy to run alone in the local elections seemed a courageous decision . 
it seemed the party was planning to test its potential , train its team and promote fresh politicians . 
but the examples in Bucharest , Giurgiu and Suceava show us a totally different thing . 
it shows us a bunch of candidates who will only damage the party 's image in the long run . 
and a sense of cynicism that can be penalized even by a less politically astute and aware electorate .
