i ponder trying to figure out how mister Ion Iliescu could smack " everybody on the gob so that they will know their place " . 
easier said than done . 
any Romanian when " plastered " can grumble over a plum brandy : " Man , if I get angry , I ' ll smack Clinton on the gob so hard he ' ll see stars ! " . 
what he says is of no consequence . 
not even a leaf in the mulberry tree leaning over the brasserie will stir . 
Ion Iliescu in his turn can make any statements he pleases . 
tomorrow at a press conference he can say gentlemen , I am planning to kick all Martians in the ass to teach them to know their place on Mars ! 
this would sound nice , we would have great fun , but nothing more . 
Martians will not present their tush for the educational kick , and our venerable politician will not follow his words with action . 
our problem is much simpler . 
we want politicians who say this or that then do what they said . 
but mister Iliescu got angry with the American Congressmen Christopher Smith and Frank Wolf over their having said something he did not like . 
what can we do about them ? 
nothing at all . 
they spoke their mind and that 's that . 
if it 's some nonsense , Americans will laugh at them and stick to their unbridled liking for the PDSR leader . 
but if the two Congressmen 's opinions match those of other politicians , then things could get more complicated . 
Ion Iliescu could have a problem . 
not too big a problem , since Americans don't cast ballots in Romania . 
but as the US are a great power , their opinion counts . 
there are also European politicians who will prick up their ears to hear what the people overseas say . 
but they have brains . 
they will take in to account the opinions of the two Congressmen or pass by as if having heard nothing . 
it is not out of the question that some Europeans will come over to Ion Iliescu and ask him " what can we do to help you become Romania 's president ? " 
what would he think of them ? 
are they good people or bad people who deserve being smacked on the gob ? 
either pros or cons , we can but take stock of all this . 
we could eventually count them to see how many those in mister Iliescu 's favour are and how many against him ! 
but nothing more ! 
the basic rule of democracy is fundamental freedom : every citizen - rich or poor - is entitled to his / her opinion . 
the Americans expressed theirs , so what is the attitude we should adopt ? 
should we sue them ? 
at what court and with what money ? 
we could eventually go to the Hague Tribunal or to the UNO to complain . 
but who will take notice ? 
what if they ask us about the freedom of expression ? 
what will we answer ? 
that they are not allowed to state their opinion about a man from another country ? 
what provision in the international law punishes this ? 
let us go back to the statement Ion Iliescu made in Kishinev and thoroughly read it . 
the PDSR president did not say we should smack Smith and Wolf on the gob . 
Ion Iliescu said that , in case further such instances occur , " we should smack everybody on the gob " . 
the situation is similar to the one in the joke with the guy beaten up by a brawler . " Yo , if you strike me a gain , I ' ll do what my father did ! " , the guy threatens . 
the brawler smacks him a gain in the eye . 
the assaulted guy responds " Yo , listen to me , if you lay a finger on me , I ' ll really do what my father did ! " 
the brawler , without stopping to think about it , strikes him another blow . 
" now I ' ll really do what my father did " , the assaulted guy says , livid . 
and he suddenly turns his back and walks a way grumbling " that 's what my father did when he realized there 's no reasoning with such a guy ! " . 
it is pretty much how the statement in Kishinev sounds . 
the strange thing is that , figuratively speaking , Ion Iliescu can smack all his opponents on the gob . 
firstly , by a civil choice of words . 
secondly , by admitting obvious truths . 
but he can smack them hardest on the gob by letting them voice anything that crosses their mind , that is by ignoring them and doing exactly what the electorate expects him to , namely coming up with plausible solutions to the state of affairs in Romania . 
the only acceptable way in which we can smack the Americans , Germans and British on the gob is to make Romania sort of a Swiss or Japanese clock . 
and this is exactly the thing which is not easy for us to do . 
Ion Iliescu had this opportunity , but the clock worked as if its mechanisms were sheep sorrel . 
Emil Constantinescu had this opportunity in his turn and instead of winding it up , he clogged the clock with stinging nettle . 
so neither can smack the Americans , Germans , Russians or British on the gob . 
they could eventually smack us on the gob so that we will keep mum . 
but this wouldn't be democratic . 
in the accusation brought against the BBC ( while in Kishinev ) , Ion Iliescu forgets the essential , namely that everything what the radio station reported on the " Zavtra " note turned out to be true , in black and white , and that from the journalistic point of view the subject is closed . 
it is still opened where the political point of view is concerned . 
the parties and citizens are free to form an opinion , either good or bad , about it . 
it 's not the media 's business . 
labelling our journalist colleagues with BBC after they did their duty is just a way of smacking the press , too , on the gob . 
as this is a democracy , the consequences can only be negligible . 
but nobody can prevent the people from having an opinion . 
and this is the hardest blow to strike somebody , aiming at their gob or at their credibility .
