the joke played yesterday by " Evenimentul zilei " newspaper annoyed a lot of people . 
a missile fired from Jimbolia , on Romanian territory , downs the first invisible American aircraft . 
that was quite a scoop ! 
the domestic and foreign mass media called us in desperation to get that non - existent NATO communique which would have thrown us in the middle of a conflict . 
Fortunately , it was but an April Fool 's Day joke ! 
we take this opportunity to apologize to those who took some time to realize it wasn't about a real piece of news . 
Miron Cozma 's break out from jail , the invisible railway cars to be produced in the Romanian town of Arad , Petre Roman to be appointed prime minister , Lucescu becoming Steaua football coach and underground figure Fane Spoitoru 's return to Romania were enough indication to make people realize all was a joke . 
but despite all these precautions , many readers took the bait , be it just for a short time . 
they got scared , they saw the war closer to them , they even started to think how to work out a plan to flee the area , and some turned their hopes to God . 
the first thing this joke played on the international day of practical jokes is that under the circumstances of the terrible anxiety people are currently experiencing many Romanians are ready to believe anything they hear or read about . 
they don't take time to thoroughly check on a piece of information , they haven't yet got used to cross - ckeck an information and then try to figure out whether it is true or not . 
secondly , the fact that many people were fooled showed us that a lot of Romanians think all sorts of absurd things can occur here in our country , including a fact such as firing a missile from a military unit in Jimbolia fatal to an invisible aircraft . 
many other people simply flew in to a rage and mentioned the war next to our borders saying this is something no one should joke about . 
the war is a tragedy . 
we have to admit they speak the truth . 
but on the other hand , we should not forget that ever since Adam was a boy laughter has had a purifying function and brings relief beneficial to people 's state of mind . 
but most of the people who realized it was about a joke did that by using a rational judgement , that is Romania has no radars to detect the superaircraft , nor has it missiles to shoot it down . 
it sounds reasonable ! 
but the Serbs did have ! 
and they don't have that much military equipment . 
a simple line of reasoning tells us that no matter how outdated their military equipment are , they must have got something more from somewhere . 
maybe only the Americans think that F - 117 is an invisible aircraft , maybe others have watched it for a while and now they only proved they could see it . 
which makes us think further and realize that all sort of state - of - the - art and breakthrough in military equipment have been thrown in the conflict in Yugoslavia . 
some say just take a look and see what we have , the others complain they are poor , but then they give signs they are not that poor . 
some throw some fresh techological development in to the battle , and the other side comes with an antidote . 
and imperceptibly tension builds up to alarming highs . 
Solana compares Milosevic to Ceausescu . 
Russians deploy warships to Mediterranean , there are increasing talks about a ground attack and there are discussions about province Kosovo 's autonomy . 
meanwhile , the Serbs present the three captured American soldiers like some exotic prey and gather around Milosevic like fingers clenched in to the palm . 
in translation , gas cylinders start leaking and it smells of explosion . 
it will be a while until the flame of a cigarette lighter can cause things to blow up , but on the other hand the devastating moment is not such a long while off . 
and as it happens in all miserable situations , nobody is willing to take a step back . 
whenever one side moves , the other one suicidally moves further . 
judged from this angle , Primakov 's trip to Milosevic and Schroeder was a chance if not for bringing the war to an end , then at least a good opportunity for a time - out in a race that unfolds like greased lightning and breaks down all bridges to a return to negotiations . 
it 's true that on April Fool 's Day we held our lighters close to Romanians ' anxiety - filled cylinders . 
but right now someone else is walking with fireworks among the planet 's killer gas - filled cylinders .
