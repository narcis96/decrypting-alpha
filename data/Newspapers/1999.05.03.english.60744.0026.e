many people this year scoffed at the May Day . 
the labour celebrating holiday has turned in to some people 's laughing stock . 
to some others , it has become a reason for nostalgia . 
but the essence of this issue has nothing to do with either of these two attitudes . 
throughout the years , the International Labour Day was attached absurd political exaggerations . 
the day provided the occasion that once a year the working class be paid a substantial compliment by the communist nomenclature . 
all those parades with people carrying the portraits of Marx , Engels and Lenin , which were overshadowed by the portraits of the ruling family , were but a flower pinned at a hat put on a popular day , on the need for entertainment and on an event that , at social level , marked what in ritual practices or in the religious calendar has almost the same meaning : the joy springtime sparks . 
all civilizations and almost all nations have such holidays or events that are red letter days in the calendar . 
communists only stuck their symbols on a day that marks the boundary between seasons . 
after 1990 , we ignored or ridiculed May Day because of its political connotations and to show our contempt for the " golden age " . 
which doesn't mean people don't need a party , or an event , or a symbol to mark the nature rebirth . 
the seaside party craze on this occasion shows us the same thing . 
even entertainments whose goal was to make a parody of bygone days drew audience out of the same desire to celebrate springtime . 
the disappearance of communist May Day festivities left an empty space in the calendar nobody bothered to fill with something else . 
there was nothing spectacular about festivities and celebration parties this year , no matter whether they were serious or mock festivities , and their number was extremely low at nation - wide level . 
they say festivities staged by Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy and the Labour Socialist Party were allegedly funnier than those staged by PRO TV station and PRO FM radio station . 
and I can't see any contradiction in this fact . 
it 's just a different response by two generations to the same need for marking the triumph of spring . 
from this point of view , I find the picnics organized by Ion Iliescu and Ilie Verdet indicative of exemplary normality . 
we can no longer glorify the Romanian workers by staging bombastic parades . 
but this doesn't mean we should ignore them . 
we don't have to honour them by staging theme dances , but they can't be humiliated and treated as a nuisance . 
they exist , together with all their worries and their desire to feel the joy of life and to have fun . 
but after the fall of communism , nobody tried to fill the gap and give the day tarnished under the then rule a fresh contents , more natural and close to the souls of people stripped of May Day symbols . 
it even surprises me that the current rulers organized no outing , that they rejoiced at the prospects of taking rest on a day off instead of going on a picnic with the people they have big troubles to communicate with . 
what would have been the harm if the Christian Democrats and the Liberals , even president Emil Constantinescu , had gone out on an outing to meet with ordinary people and talk with them over barbecued food and some beer ( all the more since I ' m sure all of them fled Bucharest to go to Snagov residential village near the capital city or some other place ) ? 
who would have been harmed and who would have considered their move indicative of communist nostalgia ? 
from this point of view , the two socialist leaders proved smarter . 
which doesn't mean we miss the May Day low - down show staged by Ion Iliescu at the time he was in power . 
but what we have to do with here is just a commonplace truth . 
that people need holidays and parties and they feel the lack of a tradition in this respect . 
in the communist years , there were also meetings organized in Costinesti seaside resort where the youth were acquainted with Romanian history ( and this was another event fabricated to assume political connotations ) , and there were also floral holidays , and holidays to mark the beginning of the pasture season , plus some parish fair holidays . 
but people still lack events and places to enable them feel the joy of life . 
to enable them put jobs , politics , unemployment and hardships behind them for a while , in order to get a breath of oxygen and be able to resume their daily agony . 
the fall of communism left us with nothing in this respect . 
we seclude ourselves from the world , or we go on small group outings , but local communities haven't found yet a substitute for the former May Day celebrations . 
if people hadn't felt any need for such celebrations , the communists ' campaign to graft their ideology in to this day wouldn't have been successful . 
therefore , we have to find something that will replace this holiday , no matter if we mock at the way May Day was celebrated under Ceausescu 's rule . 
because this day should be a pretext for popular outdoor parties , even in a time when there are few things that can boost our party mood .
