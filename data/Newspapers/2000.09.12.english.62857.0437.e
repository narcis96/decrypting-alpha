do you know what the difference between boors and the rest of the people is ? 
it 's very simple ! 
boors think the whole world was made for them alone . 
they are sort of solitary individuals . 
the rest of their fellow human beings don't matter at all . 
they could die , go starving , find no way to get to their homes or their plot of land . 
they can dry out with thirst . 
boors can convince nobody of any idea , and they are not able to communicate with a cat , let alone one with their fellow humans . 
moreover , boors feel an acute need to be respected by the others . 
and because there 's no way they can get the others ' respect , they imagine they can buy it or force them to do so . 
boors never see themselves as members of the community they are part of . 
they see the others as some ordinary , poor , moronic people only worth being despised . 
or punished . 
boors are those people who want to trim everybody only because the latter won't share their crippled ideas . 
repeating a platitude , we say that as a rule boors are people who got rich overnight . 
but even in times of poverty they still were boors . 
these specimens also exist in the fully - fledged capitalist societies in France or Britain , not to mention Romania . 
in Ceausescu 's days , they would be bred in all sorts of nurseries ( read organizations ) and stimulated to develop . 
in a democratic society , if in addition they have money and can grease palms , boors are as dangerous as they were in the socialist years . 
in those days they would rat on you to your boss , the militia , the political police , the youth organizations and would transform each snitch operation in to a success in their job , a pretext for self - assertion or promotion . 
now boors can bring you to a limit situation with a cheque , a contract , an absurd gesture more difficult to deal with than a Gordian knot . 
they are sort of all - mighty gods , but with no brains or community spirit . 
i met this sort of people on various occasions , small - time or big - time bosses , businessmen , even culture figures . 
they may be painters of genius , or sublime music performers , and as soon as they come down from the art realm they will hoof worse than a horse scared by a wolf . 
Russians who would look at your watch and then say give it to me were boors , as well as the capitalist Oltenian * ( about whom we carry an article in today 's issue ) who bars people 's way out of their homes , people keeping their wells under lock and key , or those who erect their homes in the middle of the road . 
land restoration has triggered a lot of situations that show Romanians are far a way from their idyllic image depicted in our national ballad Miorita . 
" it 's mine and the others may just drop dead " has been an often heard slogan that distinguishes a turkey from a human being and a boor from a citizen . 
there is a right in Romania , through the laws that date back to the Code drawn up by Alexandru Ioan Cuza . 
the right to easement . 
i think it can be traced back to Napoleon or even earlier days . 
in fact , it derives from the human nature defined by freedom . 
but not even the sacred right to private property can keep some people confined or account for the blocking of the access road to their home . 
these days we keep talking about respect for property . 
it 's a fundamental component of democracy and the market economy . 
but we speak too little about respect for our fellow human beings and the community we live in . 
we came to the point where in the name of property we can torment other people , or even deprive them of essential rights . 
there is something Romanian and universal about the story in Craiova ( in point of stupidity ) . 
when they don't have enough troubles on their mind , people will cudgel their brains to bring some disaster in to their fellow humans life . 
because this is what happens to the professors in Craiova forced to get out of their yard by using a ladder . 
normally , what happened in Craiova should right a way be entered in an anthology of human stupidity and marked by a crystal statue with the following words written at its bottom : " Full transparency . 
no trace of brains visible . 
" we are free , democratic , but some people 's minds are producing some humming tops able to block streets , sometimes even cities , and if we don't pay heed , they could paralyze the whole country in no time .
