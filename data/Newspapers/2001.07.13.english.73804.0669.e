" Sweetheart , take these millions of lei and go to the seaside or to a disco in Bucharest ! " . 
with these words , many parents spoilt their children and turned them in to good - for - nothing people . 
most often these unnecessary gifts turn against them . 
the children , now grown up but still like some fragile and dependent plants , eventually come to pray for their parents to die so that they get the last money and their share of inheritance . 
premier Adrian Nastase made a similar gesture . 
the " father " of a poor budget , the premier visited the other day a summer schools called " 21 st century Romania " and told the 53 students : " I don't think it 's bad for the students to win a scholarship abroad or go to work there because they learn all sorts of things , they socialize in international teams and send money home , last year the amount was 1 billion dollars " . 
( we quoted from " Adevarul " daily newspaper ) . 
in other words , guys , go and work , even abroad , try to get integrated into serious collectives , learn what real work means and send the money home ! 
the piece of advice seems appropriate to me . 
but instead of being heard only by 53 students at a summer school , the speech should have been repeated by the premier , the president , and all those whose voices are important in Romania . 
instead of endlessly lamenting that our young people are leaving the country , we should better urge them to stop idling their time a way and try to make some money . 
unfortunately , when he finished giving the students some advice worthy of a premier of Romania , Adrian Nastase made a gesture typical of a nabob - premier or of a father indulgent with his offspring . 
he gave each student attending the summer school an envelope with 3 million lei , a sort of gift , as if he said , you , have some pocket money here to spend at the seaside ! 
the difference between " gift " and " propagandist incentive " is almost imperceptible in this case . 
does the budget allot the premier enough money so that he may offer such envelopes to all young people he meets ? 
is this gesture aimed at encouraging a responsible attitude of the young people towards work ? 
and if the premier really has money to reward the students for their successes , why did he choose to do it at a summer school ? 
has money been given to the attendants of other summer schools too ? 
if the envelopes with money were handed only to the students at the respective " school " why didn't Adrian Nastase use the money to reward other Romanians students who won prizes at international contests ? 
does the premier know how many young people knock at the doors of institutions to get a sponsorship they need to compete in all sorts of international contests , and eventually they are unable to leave ? 
if the Prime Minister 's speech seems appropriate to me for the current situation of the young people , his gesture is that of jolly wedding guest , determined to flex his muscles before those standing agape with amazement : " Hey , you , take some money to drink a beer , and go to the seaside with what 's left ! 
and don't forget that Godfather pays for everything ! 
" the premier 's attitude , a part from its arrogance , reminds me that in 1996 , in a poor province town , miners ' leader Miron Cozma , dreaming of becoming one day a senator for Hunedoara county , used to throw a way banknotes from his car window . 
the effect was opposite .
