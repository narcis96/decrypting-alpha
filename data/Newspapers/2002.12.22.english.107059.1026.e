i don't know how it happens that every time at the end of the year we deal with a political earthquake . 
stuffed cabbage rolls were boiling in the pots , and instead of wine the country was served a promise which has never been fulfilled . 
as if political carols were never sung during the Christmas season , this year the same play was acted . 
the difference is that it has another producer and is made in several parts . 
on Wednesday in parliament , Ion Iliescu made an analysis of the corruption phenomenon , obviously hinting at the government . 
as a matter of fact , the presidential anti - corruption , announced this time as a " shock therapy " , is aimed at the " relation - based capitalism formed in Romania " . 
the speech of president Ion Iliescu , delivered symbolically half - way through his term of office , came against the background of differences of opinion between the Cotroceni and Victoria Palaces on the issue of early elections . 
the message was not hesitant this time , but categorical . 
when he spoke of a resignation enbloc of the government , the president said : " It 's his concern ! " 
obviously this " It 's his concern ! " was addressed to Adrian Nastase . 
" it 's his concern ! " had a stronger impact than a threat . 
it filled the opposition with enthusiasm , it aroused applause and gave the impression that hidden cards are still being played . 
but the game will start after the New Year . 
for the supporters of the president , " It 's his concern ! 
" sounded like a threat , whereas for his opponents - like a big defeat of Adrian Nastase . 
this simple sentence showed its effects very soon . 
yesterday , in the videoconference with the prefects , Adrian Nastase sort of sounded retreat , especially as regards early elections . 
but he also did it in connection with the substantial ( or " significant " ) cabinet reshuffle . 
he announced that his government would not resign , would not be reshuffled , and we would not have early elections . 
the best solution , said the Prime Minister in a videoconference , will be that in the forthcoming period ( after January 3 , of course ) , the executive should prepare a new programme , " a supplement to the governing programme " , with which should come before the parliament . 
" instead of landing our plane to fill it up and land safely in 2007 we will probably have the fill - up while still flying " , said Adrian Nastase . 
this might sound like a retreat , like an acceptance of priorities announced after the meeting with Ion Iliescu . 
at a first look , the Prime Minister 's message looks like a surrender at Christmas time . 
in fact , it is a sort of maintaining positions , with the corrupt and the non - corrupt , with the competent and the incompetent , with local barons and advisors . 
it would mean for us to believe that Adrian Nastase serenely announced a catastrophe for the people , the party , and for himself . 
Malicious , he even spoke of a " vote of confidence for the government from the opposition parties " . 
as a president of all Romanians , Ion Iliescu offered everyone during the holiday season a portion of anti - corruption , plus one of anti - poverty , and a small one of anti - bureaucracy . 
on the other side , under the appearance of a defeat , Adrian Nastase preferred to offer the members of the government a quiet minivacation . 
there will be no cabinet reshuffles , no resignation enbloc , no early elections . 
no cabinet minister will spend his holiday worriedly . 
will he stay in office or not ? 
one spread tinsel over the executive , while the other spread tinsel over the country . 
but for all those who understand and know what tension is smouldering , putting out fireworks at the New Year might mean the very darkness ready to be broken by the first tracers , and then by dazzling cannon rounds .
