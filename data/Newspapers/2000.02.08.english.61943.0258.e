politics and the money rush have made us go grey . 
prices turn our heads spinning . 
but what about the human side inside each of us ? 
don't tell me this side of us too is concerned about money , politics and prices . 
definitely no ! 
because it would be too little . 
our life is made up of other things too . 
it 's full of tragedies , stories , experiences . 
Saturday we ran an interview with Cristina Ionescu Costea , an English teacher in Bucharest , who chose to take up a job on a cruise ship together with her husband . 
her three - year long adventure on ships sailing to the Caribbean Sea has triggered a wave of reactions from our readers , which is a sign that real life stripped of make up , false prudery or writing embellishments is far more interesting than politics , crimes , rapes or the politicians ' dummy statements . 
which is why we decided to go on with these unprejudiced dialogues . 
today 's issue runs the story of a prostitute in Bucharest . 
you shouldn't pull a wry face , prostitutes are humans too ! 
it is not her fault that she was raped when she was fourteen years old and that she had unjustly become the laughing stock of her native community , though she had done nothing wrong . 
quite on the contrary , she had fallen victim to a blamable act . 
she tried to forget what had happened to her running a way from those who knew her and plunging in to that part of Bucharest where sordidness , promiscuity and lawbreaking are rulers . 
like any other big city , Bucharest will absorbe anything and devour people just like a garbage disposal device . 
the city 's outskirts , the underworld and the dark parts of the capital are the places where pecking order is a rule , weak impressionable people are crushed and personal tragedies are ceaselessly unfolding . 
many out there go straight in to the dark . 
very few come back to light . 
and authorities ' and press ' eye only seldom opens wide to see what 's going on in that dark world . 
which is why the interview with the English teacher ( a person of exemplary courage amidst the multitude of acquiescent Romanians ) was the inspiration for this series of " Nonconventional dialogues " . 
we ' ve had enough of politicians ' and businessmen 's chattering . 
top public figures too get carried a way when they come in the spotlight and start giggling as soon as they find themselves speaking in to a mike . 
but what about ordinary people ? 
they will keep silent , clench their teeth and curse everything from the day they were born to the whole planet . 
but their voices are seldom heard . 
which is one of the reasons why our " Nonconventional dialogues " will host ordinary people . 
street vendors , wardens , prostitutes , destitutes , nameless runaways , retired people , all those who want to make their voice heard and have something to tell about their troubles or about personal experiences that could be a help to their fellow humans . 
" Evenimentul zilei " opens its pages to everybody . 
exposing abuses and lawbreaking will continue to be our main goal . 
all those who hold evidence or credible information are invited to behave like true citizens . 
that is to muster their courage to come to our editorial office and take responsibility for their stories . 
we will be right behind them hundred percent . 
but not only people waging a war are invited to speak their mind . 
in time and depending on the printing space available , we ' ll give all of them the opportunity to tell their stories . 
as a matter of fact , hundreds of readers have written us so far and we ' ve run their stories in the column headlined " Romanians and their heartaches " . 
These dialogues want to go further . 
they want to bring to light some topics other publications in their rush for scoops have overlooked . 
they plan to present a whole world of people and biographies , tragedies and stories , in other words life in all its diversity and beauty . 
even life 's most tedious routine can be a pearl oyster . 
but in order for us to attain the goals we ' ve set ourselves when starting this series of dialogues , we need our readers support . 
by mail or by phone they can get us in touch with their friends , acquaintances or relatives . 
how deep we ' ll go in to this bounderless territory is up to them only . 
some of them may reproach us for having chosen to start our series of dialogues with the story of a prostitute . 
but you will see that sometimes we may be wrong when we accuse somebody . 
a girl was strong enough to get out of the slime , she accepts her condition , but shows she still has character . 
she came to us not to complain about her past , but to warn girls and prevent them from being caught in the same trap . 
you know what the most shocking discovery is after a conversation with a prostitute ? 
that a human being who lives in the debasement inferno can preserve his or her conscience almost intact .
