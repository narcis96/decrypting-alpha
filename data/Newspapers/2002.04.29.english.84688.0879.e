if you were to buy a plant in some neighbouring country and then were chased a way by workers , what would you say ? 
the first reaction would be to cross yourself , pack your things and say bye bye , I won't set foot on this land a gain . 
the American investor who took over the steel mill in Resita town ran in to a lot of trouble . 
the government failed to give him what they promised , the investor failed to put in to the business the amount of money written in the contract , the workers wouldn't accept him as they felt their plant will go to ruin . 
they went to court , quarrelled , picked on each other , the privatisation authority and the government acted as arbitrators , but things didn't clear up . 
the story of the American who got entangled in the maze of the Romanian economy is not an isolated case . 
others too got burned , Kvaerner company with Bucharest - based IMGB , the Czechs with SILCOTUB company in Iasi and others . 
but the most spectacular deadlock situation occurred in Tecuci town . 
Pol Am Pack , a Polish company with an American investor ( one of the world 's biggest ) bought the main share package in the only metallic packs plant in Romania . 
the plant in Tecuci town . 
in 1997 , Pol Am Pack acquired from the then privatisation authority FPS a 50 . 948 % share in the company for 1,250,000 dollars , pledging to invest another 7 . 
6 million dollars in the company . But later the buyer failed to invest all the promised money . 
anyway , Pol Am Pack has come to own 92 . 47 % of the company 's shares . 
the comedy started the moment the Polish company became the major shareholder , not to say overwhelmingly major . 
since then , the Polish company 's officials have been able to enter their plant in Tecuci only accompanied by police forces . 
and several times not even with support from police . 
a conflict broke out between the two persons forming the company 's board ( one of them of Polish nationality , who at a certain time was representing the owners ) . 
endless trials started , with every new one more shocking than the previous and solved in the most absurd way . 
in vain did the privatisation authority APAPS give the Polish a paper certifying they owned 92 . 47 % of the company , in vain did they file complaints with all authorized bodies , in vain did they take the matter to the court . 
the Polish - American company can't enter their plant . 
the fight with two persons on the plant 's payroll and with the workers has reached the bodyguard phase . 
both parties the night before last night slept in the plant either guarded by its own musclemen . 
the company 's management and the workers won't hand over the reins to the lawful owners . 
I don't know how the war in Tecuci will end ( a much more discrete war than others because the Polish chose to take the matter before justice and were reluctant to speak on TV stations ) . 
but the problem lies somewhere else . 
Romania is complaining about the lack of investors and is ready to do anything to convince foreigners that the country offers incredible business opportunities . 
at the same time , those who dare come here end up by having to fight not only against the workers ' mentality , but also against the system 's weaknesses . 
it 's strange that in Galati county , from press to police and from judges to authorities , nobody has rushed to see that the law is enforced and that the Polish owners are restored their rights . 
it 's possible that many reacted by saying " what the hell , we 're Romanians , we won't put the company in to the foreigners ' hands " . 
but the consequence in point of the perception of the Romanian economic and judicial framework is catastrophic . 
and if the Polish are going to do exactly what I was saying in the beginning of my article that a Romanian would do if he were to buy a plant in a neighbouring country and then were hampered from entering it , then certainly all our attempts to convince investors to come to Romania will end in smoke .
