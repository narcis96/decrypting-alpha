the Americans must have rubbed their hands when they read the article in " The Washington Post " and they said to themselves " what do you know , the opinion of a Romanian party leader who studied in Moscow fits us just like a glove ! 
how nicely and convincingly he calls on us not to allow Russians come back to South - Eastern Europe ! " 
at the same time , many people back in Romania couldn't believe their eyes when reading this . 
how can this be , Ion Iliescu in America speaks against the Russians , whereas in Bucharest he abstains from voting to grant NATO access to the country 's airspace . 
the news and then the press report must have bewildered a lot of people . 
but taking a look at the article published in the United States allows us to understand some things . 
on one of his former visits to America , Iliescu made a similarly shocking statement on the right to property . 
once back home , he somehow changed his statement and convinced us it was not about a radical shift of stand . 
the article this time is really something new . 
the fact that Ion Iliescu took this step is commendable . 
but at the same time we shouldn't allow ourselves to get carried a way with this first impression . 
Ion Iliescu makes reference to the Russian elite he once got acquainted with . 
he 's free to do it . 
but the things he knows may not fit the current team in Moscow , because neither current prime minister Stepashin , nor Chubais or Cernomirdin were his schoolmates . 
moreover , Iliescu either has some memory problems , or he misinterprets the events occured in 1996 , as This is what suits him now . 
he now says that Russia " has so far refused to sign a basic treaty with Romania " . 
which is far from being correct . 
let 's remember that in the spring of 1996 we were one step a way from concluding the treaty , and when Evgeniy Primakov came to Bucharest , he was told right after getting off the plane that Ion Iliescu had reversed his decision on signing the basic treaty and that he preferred to postpone the move . 
Ion Iliescu in his interview with the American daily also asks the West not to force Romania " open its borders and highways to the Russian troops and tanks heading for Kosovo " . 
but has there really been such a demand or , at least , such a proposition ? 
the Foreign Ministry should immediately confirm or infirm this thing . 
and there is one more problem . 
of course , we can talk about the borders , but we can't talk about highways , as we have none . 
the Pitesti highway is just a poor road with works under way . 
but let 's read on . 
in order to justify his stand , Ion Iliescu says that " intolerant nationalism in Serbia will not be moderated by forces from a country where militarism and nationalism are on the rise " . 
as far as we know , " pal " Jirinovsky 's opinion poll ratings are on the down , and as far as militarism is concerned , maybe Iliescu knows more than we do about this . 
Ion Iliescu also says that " Tomorrow 's Russia will be hostile to us " . 
though this may prove true in time , Ion Iliescu is not allowed to make such a statement in his capacity as head of the main opposition party , as former Romania 's president and even as future presidential candidate . 
the only interesting viewpoint occurs in the end of the article : NATO should make peace with Yugoslavia through Romania , in order for the situation of " hostile neighbour " to be avoided . 
this is not a bad idea , but it 's hard to be put in practice , as it 's very unlikely that we will have the force to mediate such a difficult peace process . 
the fact that Ion Iliescu so firmly breaks up with Moscow has rather to do with his personal credibility , though , as an outstanding politician , he shouldn't have made such statements . 
they may cost him a lot . 
only his almost desperate wish to convince the Americans that he is not a filo - Russian could have driven him to make those statements . 
in fact , the article 's key is not his fear that the Russians will transit Romania on their way to Kosovo . 
he only tried to revamp his image in America , hoping he would get approval of his dream to become Romania 's president once a gain . 
Iliescu went public with his views . 
all we can do is wait and see the results . 
" the Washington Post " is a very important American newspaper . 
but it stands neither for America , nor for a state 's policy . 
not even for the American press . 
which means there 's a long way to go until he gets where he plans to get .
