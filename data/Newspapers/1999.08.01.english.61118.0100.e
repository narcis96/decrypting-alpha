if you went to the market today and you couldn't believe your eyes seeing the price of a kilo of peaches or of a pair of shoes you wanted to buy , then you 're not fit to do business in Romania . 
it is clear that you don't know how to make money and that you got no dollar from a black hole such as the Galati - based iron - and - steel works . 
Sidex You didn't take a cent , but you put in , as it was from the public purse that the money was put in all black holes out of which our famous iron - and - steel works Sidex is the deepest . 
Sidex debts amount to 600 million dollars . 
i honestly don't think it was so hump - backed when Nicolae Ceausescu left it to us . 
the hump has gradually " accrued " , as market economy has been most wildly enforced upon the famous iron - and - steel works near the Danube river , a plant which used to be named " the pride of socialist industry " . 
and since you went to the market and bought neither sheet iron nor billets or rail , but found out instead about the government meeting during which the change of the Sidex chairman of the Board of Directors was decided , then it is worth wondering what happened . 
three months after the appointment of Flavius Moldovan whom Radu Sirbu , the head of the FPS privatisation agency , brought over from Cluj , the government decided that another public servant take over leadership , namely the prime - minister 's adviser Petrisor Peiu . 
Petrisor Peiu is a Christian - Democrat with the young guard and so far he has been in charge of negotiations with trade unions . 
his appearance is that of a good boy , he talks briefly and when not in the know he doesn't give himself a way . 
but he didn't accomplish much either . 
it was he who talked last September of " halting the economic decline " . 
the government put on the brake , but the economy kept on rolling downwards . 
as to the statement that " it is up to us to proceed to real restructuring , that is cutting to the quick " , we saw what it came of it . 
Radu Vasile and Petrisor Peiu implicitly only cut the polenta and when they burnt their fingers they blew a little on them and said sorry . 
therefore Petrisor Peiu , an electronist by training , was sent to Galati after having brilliantly advised premier Radu Vasile . 
what is Sidex ( besides an iron - and - steel works and a black hole in the Romanian economy ) ? 
it 's very simple ! 
Romania 's largest exporter is a public treasury in which all the wise guys in the country have their hands up to their elbows . 
how are they selected since anybody can think of himself as being smart and may want to pilfer something ? 
it 's very simple a gain ! 
this is done according to political criteria . 
after 1990 , all schemes you could think of and all those that wouldn't cross your mind have been used to defraud Sidex . 
based on the parasite - companies criterion , Sidex has been surrounded by crocodiles . 
and each one of them ripped out chunks of the profit . 
he who only took two or three truckloads of sheet iron can weep for having got a mere trifle , since others stole ship and freight train - loads of products . 
it was the heyday of the PDSR party when the Siderman company was set up whose sole responsibility was to manage the iron - and - steel works . 
and when cards were dealt out according to the established criteria ( that is you 're with us or you 're against us ) , the then - ruling party PDSR conducted the crocodiles ' lunch . 
shell companies with politicians and MPs behind them made a historic contribution to the disapppearance of the money . 
besides , there were the foreign trade firms of the former officers with the communist - era Securitate and with the foreign intelligence service SIE . 
and there were the foreign firms , too . 
about all sinewy predators feasted on the money of the large iron - and - steel works . 
the PDSR lost 1996 elections . 
it was then FPS head Sorin Dimitriu to call the defraud tune . 
he replaced part of the Sidex clientele Paul Pacurariu , a notorious Liberal , became very knowledgeable about the steel industry and began to lobby for exports . 
the war started between Balli and Metanef and between the clientele of the PDSR and of the current rulers respectively . 
debts have increased proportional to the holes that tend to turn in to a precipice . 
now Sidex has to pay back 600 million dollars . 
but the money is at firms clung like leeches to the production process at the Galati - based works . 
actually everybody puts in Sidex sort of an expensive earth as iron ore to obtain a cost - efficient steel they sell at a good price and forget the money faw a way abroad . 
Sidex is in fact but the Sodom and Gomorrah of Romanian industry . 
the only ones not stealing are the workers who cannot go back from work carrying billets on their back . 
and since you bought no peaches from the market today , it wouldn't harm wondering why was Petrisor Peiu , the one not in the know , sent to Galati . 
very simple . 
try to understand that shareouts must always be conducted by somebody , even when it comes to burial .
