they 're smart and have hot issues to handle , the poor citizens might say about the police big shots . 
that 's pretty much what we said when we learned that an Interior Ministry ( MI ) car had been involved in a traffic accident at Timisul de Sus in Brasov county . On Sunday afternoon , an officer with the minister 's office told us , based on the report made by the head of the Brasov County Police Inspectorate colonel Bucur ( I hope you remember the guy ) , that no accident had occurred at Timisul de Sus . 
only the pictures taken at the scene of the accident ( such is life , there always are a photojournalist and an eye witness where authorities expect them less ) made the department budge . 
a press release by the MI Press Office says that on Friday Ioan Rus travelled on the Bucharest - Brasov route ( the same day the accident occurred ) , but that he was riding in an Audi car . 
we ignore the first untrue statement , we also ignore colonel Bucur 's lie that there hadn't been any accident . 
aren't the pictures taken at the scene of the accident , the statements made by drivers and policemen enough for the baton - equipped ministry to admit what happened ? 
isn't the minister 's driver , or state secretary or whatever general was involved in the accident , supposed to abide by the same laws that are applicable to everybody else ? 
the others may be some ordinary drivers , some nobodies , but they can't be treated like some law breakers as long as the author of the " disturbance " was driving a police car . 
in fact , why shouldn't we suspect that it was Ioan Rus himself riding in the Volkswagen involved in the car crash ? 
the lie that the minister didn't travel in that area , the testimonies of the policemen dispatched at the scene of the accident and the fact that the Interior Ministry is trying to dodge the issue are enough reasons to support such a suspicion . 
we are faced with plenty of head lights moving past us on the roads , official motorcades driving us to the street sides , Fittipaldi - style overtaking manoeuvres by officials with the Special Security Service that give us reasons to say that rulers have got too big for their boots . 
their conceit and contempt first show on the road and then in their decisions , in the way they account for what they do , and in the ruling politicians ' soaring welfare . 
the police 's attitude concerning the car accident at Timisul de Sus is more than a blooper . 
it 's the indication of contempt gaining ground with every passing day . 
when it comes to a small - time law breaker , the authorities set the show - machine in motion to show the nation the brave honest rulers we have . 
but when it comes to one of them , to a Sorin Ovidiu Vintu - style affair , to a shady privatisation case , to swindling big money out of banks , to shady contracts , then the nation has no say . 
such cases are investigated in to , checked and analysed till they get buried for good . 
all these attempts to fool people hide nothing but deep disregard of laws and democracy . 
it 's the clear indication of indifference . 
they don't even bother to offer explanations . 
what terrible affliction does the government or Romania suffer if a minister , a general or a rank - and - file policeman makes a car driving mistake ( though we 're talking about serious damages ) ? 
would the Carpathian Mountains or the Nastase government sink in to the ground if the MI apologized , if someone took responsibility for what had happened and if punitive measures were made public ? 
would the party sweat in its silk bedclothes ? 
as long as there 's no normal reaction in a minor case such as an accident involving a police car ( with or without a minister riding in that car ) , I can't see what " improvements " we should expect in the months to come . 
the rulers have got too big for their boots and are treating us all as if we were some decorative pygmies .
