the referral from Parliament back to Government of the bill to compensate depositors with the FNI unit trust stirred up the victims a gain . 
on Wednesday they resumed protests , coming to blows with the gendarmes and trying to occupy the Universitatii Square . 
over there they chanted " We ' ll die , we ' ll fight , we ' ll get out money back " . 
it sounds pathetic , it sounds metaphoric , reminding of the young revolutionaries back in 1989 . 
just that there is a tremendous difference between overthrowing the dictatorship and getting some money back from a fraudulent investment fund . 
at the same time , the request voiced the other day , too , by the president of the National Association of the FNI Investors Ovidiu Mazilescu keeps the deadlock as such . 
he declared he wants to ask the premier that " the government issue an emergency decree providing for compensations for the investors with the last trust unit value of 103,720 lei taken in to account , irrespective of the financing sources " . 
for some people who invested their money in a financial venture it even sounds nice . 
it would be tantamount to compensations paid to those who lost money in the Caritas pyramid investment scheme , with the damages to reach not the deposited sums but eight times more , as promised under Ioan Stoica 's ploy . 
similarly , there is something incorrect about paying compensations to investors calculated based on the last trust unit value . 
i don't find such a claim very honest , particularly now when the technique used in evaluations is common knowledge . 
it won't wash when it comes to the legal or economic viewpoint or to common sense . 
even now when they learnt that the value was not real , these people still want their money back to match the levels of the declared lie . 
why ? 
because another illegality was perpetrated . 
a contract was sealed under which the CEC state - run savings bank acted as security for the fund and the CEC logo was made use of . 
we all know that the contract should not have been signed , that it was an abuse of the former CEC head Camenco Petrovici and that there were individuals interested in having the CEC act as security . 
and now the victims want a lie guaranteed through an illegality to come true . 
they want the lost money to be reimbursed from any source whatsoever , namely from public money . 
i can sympathize with some people who lost their money . 
i can agree to their being paid compensations . 
but this should be done at the expense of those who took advantage of some people 's naivety and broke the law . 
i find the claim that the victims be reimbursed from public money a sum based on an erroneous untrue evaluation to be exaggerated , even rude . 
can A few , thousands or hundreds of thousands of people be happy that a forlorn hope will come true for them through a hole blown in the state budget , that a few will cash in what they only held in their dreams while the rest of the Romanians will contribute to their well - being , to their making " a bomb " ? 
as long as the value of 103,720 lei per trust unit is untrue their request to be released from the budget such an amount is likely to be labelled as stealing from the others . 
this technique resembles that of the parasite - companies , of the commissions . 
they want sort of a bribe because some adventurers found a fool ( or a law - breaker ) with the CEC who signed a contract , though he did not have the right to initial the document or use the institution seal to stamp it . 
and even if this contract is deemed legal by the justice , the CEC still should not be entitled to pay compensations to the amount of an utopia . 
i will not approach the legal side of the issue . 
this is up to the nit - pickers . 
but from a moral viewpoint , I don't find this to be honest . 
it would be to place these financial ventures , named " funds " , even above the banks . 
in the banking sector , the Romanian state guarantees the depositors ' money up to a certain amount . 
it is up to each saver to take the risk of loss for sums exceeding the guaranteed ceiling . 
to compensate the FNI investors to the amount of deceptive promises means to mock both the law and the banks which are banks , not " piggy - banks " . 
i find it natural that the victims need to see justice served . 
what is unnatural is their insistence in their making a stand against the state not against the guilty ones . 
it is suspicious that the victims won't mention a word about the authors of the fraud . 
and I also find it suspicious that the state institutions beat about the bush and won't tell us a word about the fraud authors , allowing the losers ' anger to vent on those managing public money . 
before them , the victims shout " let the state give us back to the amount those lying thieves said will give us ! " 
how does this sound to you ?
