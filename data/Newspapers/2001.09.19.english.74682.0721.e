Vadim bin Laden keeps talking about the terrorists trained in Romania . 
and his dear country , Romania , is gradually pushed under the sign of madness . 
the contribution of our country to a campaign against terrorism is no longer the main subject of debates . 
the consequences of the events that occurred on September 11 in the USA become of secondary importance . 
from taxi drivers to politicians , almost all our fellow countrymen are engaged in a national chatter . 
did bin Laden 's terrorists train in Romania ? 
there have also been reports on bin Laden 's statements that he allegedly has people or money in our country , and the whole national has a historic matter to clarify . 
is it true or not ? 
they no longer care about price raises , the drop in the market , or about what the Americans are preparing ! 
what tops it all is that since such an aberration was reported , the tv stations and many newspapers have kept silent about it . 
they thought that by hiding the shit thrown up by Vadim bin Laden under the mat of silence , they solve the problem . 
the people don't find out anything about the allegations , so they don't exist . 
there is nothing more false than that . 
there have been many places where Vadim bin Laden was able to spit out his nonsense and spread rumours . 
based on the same principle on which the ruling party also acted towards the madman ( they pretended not to see him or they had fun at his expense ) we have come now to this dramatic situation . 
the madman , with his nonsense nicely wrapped to seem credible , gives the Romanian society topics for discussion , ridicules initiatives , overshadows coherent decisions or laughs like a fool at simple things . 
since the launching of his aberrations about terrorists who allegedly trained in Romania , the reaction has been weak and unconvincing . 
it all boiled down to two or three statements , a threat about being brought before the court and a nicely - wrapped curse by Viorel Hrebenciuc . 
but nobody presented an official document , nobody staged a debate to explain things to people , nobody took a firm stand to teach the madman a lesson . 
as a matter of fact , our much praised democratic society , ready to fight against terrorism , attackers , and mafia , is unable to find a needle for the madman 's skin . 
it doesn't find the means to shut the madman up and teach him a lesson ! 
why ? 
because in the state institutions and among policemen and prosecutors there are enough spineless people who play for several parties ( and who subscribe in various ways to the local bin Laden ) . 
moreover , the swine , after he was allowed to climb to the top of the tree , after he performed so many acts , has the nerve to believe he is a prima donna and sings arias from operas and politics . 
besides , he has enough audience and onlookers , so that to turn Romania in to a ridiculous show , dangerous for its image , for democracy and for the state institutions . 
for ten years since the madman has made a fool of himself hardly a hundred people were able to face him . 
the others were afraid or beat about the bush , sided with him or licked his boots , thinking that the state of normality in Romania will fall from heaven and does not necessarily have to be won with efforts made by each of its citizens . 
folks , you allowed the swine to do whatever he pleased on tv , in theatres , on radio , and on the first political stage of the country . 
you had fun ! 
now figure it out for yourselves what to do with him because he is already a millstone round Romania 's neck !
