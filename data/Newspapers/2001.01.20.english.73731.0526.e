what started yesterday in the building of the National Theatre should have happened a year ago , if not two or three years ago . 
even a blind man would have seen that hardly anything would work inside the PNTCD Christian - Democratic party . 
the party put in the premier 's chair a man it knew not much about . 
it adopted him overnight , like it had done with many others , made him a big man and afterwards powerlessly watched him go flat . 
the PNTCD had been in power for some months and yet it didn't know who was in fact running the country . 
was it the party , was it then - president Emil Constantinescu or was it the " civil society " ? 
it was an instance of incoherence difficult to equal not only in Romania . 
they didn't as little as finalize as they had planned the Law on public access to Securitate records and the Law on nationalized houses ( two misfortunes that separated them from the others ) . 
the former was passed against their will , and the latter they messed up and patched the way their opponents wanted . 
i think that this sad fall comes from the very structure of the Christian - Democrats . 
at the top there were survivors of communist prisons , much too worn out by years in jail and confinement to be able to understand the surrounding reality and old - fashioned enough to no longer have the strength to change it . 
in the second echelon there gathered the descendants of those who had served the party before the communist rule , who thought that the merits of their parents or grandparents could be turned in to visiting cards . 
in the third echelon there gathered occasional supporters , followers of the Christian - Democrat doctrine and those who had scores to settle with the scornful activists in the other camp . 
then came the opportunists . 
all the array of ambitious people , rejected by the PCR communists and later on by the FSN Front of National Salvation , looked for a place to forward their political career . 
the distance between the seniors in the first category and the opportunists in the last one was not so big , but it was marked by an abyss . 
besides , the PNTCD completely lacked the experience of being in power . 
it looked like a pilot from the 40 s , out of the race for almost six decades , then re - installed overnight in control of the joystick of an IL 18 with which he was supposed to record the performance of a latest - generation Boeing . 
the result was disastrous . 
furthermore , during the power takeover in 1996 , it was like a rather old - fashioned and inexperienced pilot , but with some chances to bring the old manners back in fashion a gain , we thought . 
being courteous , being honest ! 
moral cleanness we expected from the Christian - Democrats turned out to be even below their skills . 
instead of restoring some of the moral values , seriously dented by the previous rulers , the Christian - Democrats displayed the same - and in many particular cases even bigger - weaknesses . 
plotting should also be added to all the above - mentioned weaknesses . 
no other parliamentary party after 1990 has had , in my opinion , so many inside scheming . 
teams behaving like gangs , wings with egos of a crowd , power poles with the regime of a clan , all this caused a name and address to mean too little to a political group atomized in all respects . 
what to do now , when many are leaving the boat , when even more are desperately looking for a job and a stable position , when the few who have reaped profits are growling at the mere thought of not being able to enjoy the stashed money ? 
even if some hundreds of enthusiastic people did gather at the PNTCD Congress , it is not sure they will find an answer , a path to be followed to help the party recover . 
we kept writing about this until we came to feel embarrassed before Ion Diaconescu . 
but disregarding any speculations , the conclusion is the same : he is the one mainly responsible for this downfall . 
the pettiness of the moves , the bad choice of people to work with , the lack of vision and the determination of a dusty puppet turned a decent man in to a politically guilty one . 
even the fact that today there is nobody to start the PNTCD re - birth can also be blamed on him . 
11 years after the party of Iuliu Maniu , Ion Mihalache , Corneliu Coposu and Ion Diaconescu was set up a gain , the Christian - Democrats no longer have any charismatic figure . 
around whom are they supposed to be re - born ? 
does Constantin Dudu Ionescu , Calin Catalin Chirita , Ioan Muresan or Vasile Lupu have the power to persuade and to win over followers ? 
we may be wrong today , since we lack the detachment that comes in time . 
but on a thorough review of the conduct of the four , not many elements can be listed to prove one of them may be the one waited for . 
this makes us think that the agony of this historical party will not be over just after its congress now . 
years will go by before Romanians forget the chaos during the second half of 2000 . 
there will be a while before another Iuliu Maniu rises from among the young Christian - Democrats to breathe new life in to a party which for too long has lived off shadows , egos and big words as empty as colourful balloons . 
p . S . This is a mention necessary to correctly understand the changes at the Cotroceni presidential institution . 
in 1996 at his installation as president Emil Constantinescu kept in office 30 employees who had worked with Ion Iliescu , too . 
they should still be there , unless they retired .
