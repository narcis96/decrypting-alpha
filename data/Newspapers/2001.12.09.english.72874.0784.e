thank God ! 
only a few more days and we can say we have got rid of an obsession that had been lasting for half a century . 
the Adrian Nastase government gets a huge whiteball . 
at the same time , the former government and the two prime ministers Victor Ciorbea and Radu Vasile get one more blackball . 
what they didn't manage to do in four years , the " neo - communists " have managed in less than one year . 
the truth is the Nastase government , and especially interior minister Ioan Rus , took things seriously to meet many of the requirements imposed by the EU member states . 
even though they haven't met them one hundred percent , they showed constant concern and made real progress . 
they brought laws in line with the EU legislation , started the process of tightening border checkups and passport control and step by step we have managed to overcome all obstacles . 
at the same time , the vote by the EU Justice and Domestic Affairs MInisters Council is a lesson about the way Romania can pass an international exam . 
the goal is set , requirements to be met are correctly assessed , responsibilities are shared and ticked off one by one , and success is guaranteed in the end . 
that is pretty much the way the NATO admission goal should be approached . 
Unresolved issues should be identified , responsibilities shared out and deadlines set . 
and in that case there wouldn't be any reason for us to complain about obstructive moves , ill will or to seek for other far - fetched explanations . 
the news on Friday is the talk of the town . 
it 's pointless to discuss about how much the decision is soothing Romanians ' egos and gives them an extra chance . 
the signal sent by the European Union can also be seen as a small political credit . 
not only for the Nastase government , but also for Romania in general . 
we could even say it 's a reward , in the sense that the withdrawal of visa requirement will encourage reforms and speed up the process of Euro - Atlantic integration . 
at the same time , it would be a pity for people to understand the time for endless trips to Europe has come . 
travel conditions are tougher than those imposed on Bulgarians ( mainly to the disadvantage of low income people ) , and immoderation , the foolish rush to go abroad , as well as roaming from place to place committing crimes can keep us in the position of being the continent 's problem country . 
let 's hope we won't have to deal with sensational scandals and that Romanians won't make the headlines in the foreign press , nor will they get to be the main topic of the TV newscasts . 
the visa removal will generate one more phenomenon , besides offering us the chance to get in contact with the Western democracies and learn about them . 
little by little , hard working , serious , intelligent and competent Romanians will get jobs abroad . 
they will make money in places other than their country and implicitly will compel employers at home to show them more respect . 
many other unforeseen novelties will emerge as we move closer to the European Union . 
but one thing is certain . 
all the good things will mean nothing but work , work and work a gain . 
both abroad , and at home , mornings and evenings , spring and winter . 
Romania has got rid of an annoying obsession . 
it has won a right and an award . 
but it is still far from being able to say it has made it to the other side of the fence that separates it from the West .
