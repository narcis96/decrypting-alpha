as the spots were unfolding and Bogdan Ficeac was going on relentlessly with his torrential explanations , Nicolae Vacaroiu burst out in anger . 
so what , man , if I was paid seven hundred thousand dollars ? 
how much does Hagi get paid ? 
i ' m Hagi of the finances ! 
it was like an ultimate desperate argument by means of which he was trying to defend himself . 
and a certain discontent could be read in his words . 
actually , he got less than he deserved . 
Vintu was ungrateful , and so is the country . 
the vanity of a professional engaged in a game that stopped being played in 1989 burst out for a moment . 
the notorious expert in the centralized planning of Ceausescu 's economy couldn't stand being under suspicion , nor did he understand why nobody believed him any more . 
at a certain moment , Vacaroiu produced a paper out of a bag and waved it as a saving proof that he hadn't got any money . 
i reached out for the paper and I felt him startling with fear . 
he pulled it back with a jerky move . 
that was a clear indication that he was hiding something . 
i had to ask him four times before he gave me the paper . 
it was a statement signed by Sorin Ovidiu Vintu before a notary public , made one and a half weeks after " Romania libera " daily had published the scandalous seven hundred thousand dollars ( 10 . 8 billion lei ) contract . 
it 's a post - factum , a cover - up ! 
sweat drops were running down the Senate chairman 's powdered face . 
the quick but scared look in his eyes was searching for support and help . 
the man with scarce grey hair and bent forward shoulders looked like a cornered animal , he didn't look like the state 's number two figure any more . 
his entire structure built on papers , law paragraphs and documents hard to get was collapsing . 
there was no way you could believe him any more . 
he was forcing you to suspect him of many more deals , other than those leaked from the hidden side of politics and banks . 
of other shuttle - style moves between Sorin Ovidiu Vintu 's two banks , of hot line calls , spectacular financial dribbling resulting in money losses . 
in his despair , Nicolae Vacaroiu kept repeating it 's legal , it 's legal , I ' m covered , it is not my fault , it has nothing to do with the party , I didn't know who Vintu was , I didn't know who Chelaru was ( the head of the ruling party local in Roman town ) . 
and as he was persistently repeating all these things , I became more and more convinced that everything he was denying was true and all he claimed to be true should be suspected of being the other way round . 
seven - eight meters deep should be dug under every affirmation he made . 
I burst laughing when Nicolae Vacaroiu tried to label the journalists ' attempts to figure out his ties with Sorin Ovidiu Vintu as a danger to Romania . 
the country is in pain because Nicolae Vacaroiu dribbled a bank and some public responsibilities just like Hagi used to dribble the ball . 
and instead of applauding him , the audience has the courage to ask him what was your business being there and what did you do ? 
Flu - sick Marius Tuca cut the talk show in a jiffy . 
just when I was about to ask a final question . 
Mr Vacaroiu , have you ever considered resigning your office ? 
i didn't have the time to ask that question . 
a man stooping under invisible burdens , with traces of sweat drops running on his powdered face , was going down the TV building 's stairs and then vanished a way in Bucharest 's dirty night .
