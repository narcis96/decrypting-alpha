the turmoil stirred within the ruling coalition by the Victor Babiuc case has caused all the involved parties to massively lose points . 
Babiuc finally tendered his resignation from the defence minister office on Thursday night , but the appointment of a fresh defence portfolio holder is tied on the signing of an agreement on the passage of property restoration laws and the justice system reform . 
Petre Roman declined to sign the agreement . 
at a certain moment , the senior ruling Christian Democratic Party ( PNTCD ) announced it would stick to its policies and , in case the Democratic Party ( PD ) decided to withdraw from governing , it would seek support from other political forces to secure the passage of the above - mentioned laws . 
the main opposition Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) that had been watching the show in amusement went on political vacation . 
they kept hands in pockets and greatly enjoyed the performance . 
the whole fuss suited the party perfectly . 
it boosted its party 's opinion poll ratings , improved its image a little bit tarnished following Ion Iliescu 's stupid reaction to the current power 's alleged attempts to prevent him from running in the forthcoming presidential elections and unexpectedly provided the party a historic opportunity . 
in order to better understand it , it should be said that Ion Iliescu 's party ( though it persistently tries to fake solid friendly relationship ) is facing a serious lack of credibility abroad . 
several foreign governments and newspapers gave to understand that the party was still regarded as a communist descendant , sort of a slightly revamped and freshly made up political group formed of the former communist party second and third echelon members . 
which is why reservations about PDSR 's comeback to power are still being felt everywhere abroad . 
these seem to be the only obstacles to the party 's landslide victory in the forthcoming elections . 
the condition imposed by the coalition that the Democratic Party sign the agreement on the passage of property restoration laws and on the justice system reform ( denied by Petre Roman so far ) provides PDSR the above - mentioned historic opportunity . 
on the background of the coalition crisis , PDSR this week could make an artful move . 
the party could announce it will unconditionally support and vote the laws on property restoration and on the justice system reform . 
this would entail a spectacular turn of events in the Romanian political life that could even paralyse the coalition members and block their discourse . 
the accusations brought against the party in connection with revamped former political police and communist party members joining its ranks would carry no weight any more . 
the elderly Christian Democrats and those whose properties had been taken a way under the communist rule would see their anger turned groundless . 
many of those who supported the Democratic Convention in the 1996 elections and are now disappointed with its job performance could find PDSR 's new political discourse more appealing . 
at a first sight , a part of PDSR 's classic electorate could find the shift in the party 's stand disappointing , but the damage wouldn't be so great as to cause PDSR troubles in winning the elections . 
even a postelection coalition with a Democratic Convention party would be more credible . 
what would PDSR gain by dramatically changing its discourse ? 
first of all , the move would dispel the West 's suspicions towards the party and would provide it with the only important element still missing from a democratic party 's coat of arms . 
it would automatically open the doors to the European Union , the NATO officials , the Romanian diaspora and the White House officials . 
mass media often hostile to PDSR wouldn't have much left to criticize either . 
and the ironic remarks on the party would dwindle . 
the impact would be higher and really make a difference provided that the fresh stand be taken by the party , not by Ion Iliescu . 
because the party 's head could raise more suspicions than the party itself . 
such an European stand would also provide continuity in Romanian politics . 
the West would no longer fear that the country 's development strategy will undergo important modifications and that a disproportionate leftist orientation will occur following the polls . 
PDSR may disregard the opportunity offered by the coalition scandal . 
the party may peacefully go on attending its own businesses , keep up its relentless march as it is sure of its victory in the polls and block the passage of property restoration laws . 
but the result will be really deplorable . 
it will strengthen the voters ' , the European Union 's and the international political circles ' suspicions that PDSR is a double - dealing political group and that it takes it some while before being regarded as a really democratic and European party . 
which to Romania would be a catastrophe or near .
