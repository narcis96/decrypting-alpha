in Romania there is always room for a comical perspective on tragic things . 
" Jihad " SRL ( limited liability company ) is a joke Arabs would never make . 
not to mention others . 
still , " Jihad " SRL , the funny Romanian - style perspective on fundamentalism , is about to be known around the world . 
don't laugh , because this isn't just a laughable matter ! 
the appearance of a joke is hiding a tough reality . 
" Jihad " SRL is not so far a way from " Voluntari Customs " SRL . 
do you know what this Voluntari also called Customs is ? 
it 's a customs check point owned by some Jordanian fellow . 
it 's said his name is Mohammad A . M. Ahmad . 
in papers one can find him under some other names . 
and through this " Voluntari Customs " company was carried out the large - scale fraud with imported vegetables and fruit . 
every day , between 50 and 150 lorries carrying vegetables and fruit from Turkey , Greece , the Moldovan Republic or other places used to stop at this point for being charged customs duties . 
why would they all rush to " Voluntari Customs " ? 
because the Customs Authority in April 2001 issued a resolution under which the company owned by the Jordanian - nobody Mohammad got monopoly over the vegetable and fruit imports in Bucharest and Ilfov county . 
why did the head of the Customs Authority Dinu Vama ( vama = customs in English ) , also known as Gheorghe , created this monopoly ? 
out of fraternal love ? 
out of endless admiration for an Arab fellow who used to weigh the merchandise by the eye ? 
let 's get serious ! 
we have found out one thing . 
that there was a " fee " of 150 dollars for every shipment that went through the " Voluntari Customs " . 
let 's now multiply the average number of daily shipments ( about 100 ) by the almost nailed down bribe figure . 
everybody knew the price , from drivers to cleaning women , from the manager to the Turks . 
let 's go back to our calculation . 
the result is 15,000 dollars every day . 
if we multiply 24 working days by 15,000 dollars , we get 360,000 dollars a month . 
we multiply a gain by 12 months and we get a nice figure , that is 4,320,000 dollars . 
where do you think all this money went to ? 
do you know there are rumours that Dinu Vama was imposed a certain yearly revenue figure ? 
that is , how much he should " produce " every year . 
and when things get messy , he raises the stakes ! 
could it be a connection between the daily " dues " and what " informed " citizens are saying ? 
let 's go back to vegetables and fruit . 
why was that bribe being paid ? 
it 's very simple ! 
instead of ten tons of grapes , or oranges , or tomatoes , a smaller undervalued quantity was charged customs duties for . 
that 's the way the Romanian markets got invaded by foreign farming products . 
in fact , the domestic production of vegetables and fruit was forced to kneel down only to the benefit of some mobs and in order to collect " the dues " needed at higher level . 
it 's easy to figure out that no vegetable and fruit importers volunteered to do the job for nothing in return . 
because of the exclusive right granted by Dinu Vama also known as Gheorghe , all vegetable and fruit imports were charged customs duties for at the " Voluntari Customs " point . 
did no customs officer know what was going on ? 
no police officer over there ? 
not even Dinu Vama , though all customs workers are talking about the shady affair in Voluntari ? 
Mohammad A . M. Ahmad ( ? ) got arrested . 
how much of the dirty money made by the Arabian side got you know where ? 
and how much of the money squeezed by the Romanian side got you know where ?
