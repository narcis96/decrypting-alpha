as they are floating happy on the waves of the opinion polls , Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase can be regarded as two irresponsible politicians . 
at the seaside , in Bucharest , in Slanic Moldova resort or God knows where , hotels are built or acquired under a business deal which puts a haughty satisfied smile on their faces instead of moving them to anger . 
a provocative whisper can be heard at intervals on the TV and radio stations : " Scandinavia , Scandinavia , Scandinavia .. " , like the voice of a hot line phone operator . 
but what is Scandinavia ? 
besides being the peninsula that gave us the Vikings and the mermaids of the North , " Scandinavia " is also the name of a monument of fraud and bad taste built on the Romanian sea shore . 
in Mamaia seaside resort , on the banks of the lake , a " burial vault " made of grey marble was erected with a terrace as big as a stadium stand . 
almost the entire cream of the popular music , plus Tociu and Palade , perform over there . 
inside the building there are a pub , a restaurant and a night club with a swimming pool and a striptease steel pole . 
this ridiculous unparalleled kitsch cost about 3 . 5 million dollars and is owned by RAFO Onesti , which is neither TUI , nor Neckerman or some other famous international tourism company . 
RAFO is a wretched refinery built by Ceausescu in Onesti town . 
after 1990 , RAFO went in to decline , debts started to build up , parasite companies started to swarm around it and finally it was shut down . 
in 2000 , RAFO was " turned private " ( under a secret contract ) . 
part of its debts were cancelled , part were rescheduled , and the new owners represented by Corneliu Iacubov pledged to make investments in the company , to pay off its debts to the state and to put the decrepit oil chunk back on track . 
despite parliamentary motions and all sorts of protests , RAFO is still an economic old crock . 
it 's thriving and it puts money in to five - star aberrations such as Scandinavia Hotel or Bulevard Hotel in the heart of the capital city as its debts to the state budget and to state - owned Petrom company are getting higher and higher . 
the money from unpaid taxes is invested in tourism , in sports , in politics , anything . 
actually , we can say the Romanian state has gone crazy . 
it 's inflicting financial losses upon itself . 
it complains of being cash - strapped , on one hand , but it throws its money about right in to the wallets of some privileged people , on the other hand . 
it gets no taxes from Astra , or RAFO , or Midia Navodari , amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars . 
and the same Romanian state , through Petrom , gives them some other hundreds of millions of dollars in crude oil and services which the three refineries ( represented by Ioan Nicolae , Corneliu Iacubov and Dinu Patriciu ) don't pay for . 
or they pay for them in small instalments . 
Petrom , the milk cow of all governing powers , never cries and never protests . 
answerable directly to premier Adrian Nastase , Petrom is playing the part of the former Bancorex . 
in fact , the presence of a great credit " artist " , banker Razvan Temesan , was signalled in the RAFO Onesti deal , besides Corneliu Iacubov . 
he was the one who co - ordinated the famous operation under which the promissory notes worth tens of millions of dollars were guaranteed by Moldova II Private Ownership Fund run by Corneliu Iacubov at the time . 
Bancorex collapsed , the Romanian state and FPP Moldova II will carry on paying . 
Corneliu Iacubov fled the country at the time and Razvan Temesan , after the changeover of power in 2000 , was found innocent in all penal cases he was involved in . 
what does this erotic whisper " Scandinavia , Scandinavia " on TV and radio stations announce us ? 
that the hawks of the dirty big business deals of the 1992 - 1996 period are back . 
the " whitening " political operation has been a success and now they are devouring the last dead bodies of the communist economy . 
based on similar hasty papers as those used in bank defrauding and the collapse of the National Investment Fund and SAFI , freight trains of money is taken from the public purse and discharged in to aberrant private business deals with swimming pools , music performers and striptease poles . 
it stinks awful the water of Mamaia lake on whose banks Scandinavia Hotel is located ( sort of a ridiculous palmtree in the tourism landscape so pompously announced by Dan Matei Agathon ) . 
the RAFO deal   stinks , with its financial juggling producing money for the current governing power 's hotels and other " marvellous things " . 
even the irresponsibility shown by Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase stinks , as they pretend to see nothing , understand nothing , know nothing . 
for the moment , one of the biggest scandals the second term PSD governing is involved in has only erotic modulations . 
" Scandinavia , Scandinavia ... " is what they hear , and they think it 's the voice of a beautiful woman . 
but behind the hot whispers there 's the muffled voice of the gagged Romanian justice .
