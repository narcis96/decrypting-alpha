in December 1989 , in a hotel outside the country , the teleprinter was outputting news story about Romania , with Ceausescu and Noriega making the headlines . 
suddenly , the Reuters agency announced that dissident Ion Ratiu was considering returning home to make his contribution to the promotion of democracy in Romania . 
admitting my ignorance , I wondered what it was that he wanted . 
i was sure many people would rush to Bucharest to teach Romanians how to do things . 
less than two weeks later I met Master Iancu ( that 's how people close to him will call him ) at Intercontinental Hotel . 
he wanted the two of us to start a newspaper . 
i was overwhelmed by his aristocratic air , his retinue , his black tie and the way he was writing down everything in a massive notebook . 
i was inclined to believe he was a banker , a spy , a British politician , a Freemason and a Transylvania native happy to be back home . 
in contrast with the crowd of proletarians around , Ion Ratiu looked like a gentleman familiar with the civilized world routine and rules . 
and he sort of impressed me . 
he sort of made you feel like a restless little mouse in comparison to him . 
i don't mean making here a full description of his individual traits . 
some of them would surely cause him extreme irritation . 
but since 1990 , uncle Ratiu , the nickname given to him by his fellow countrymen , has really done something to promote democracy in Romania . 
he returned home , though he could very well go on living in London or in the USA . 
i happened to be on a visit to a Romanian family of noble extract living in London when my host received a phone call from Ratiu . 
he asked how they were getting on and my host said she had cooked some excellent forcemeat rolls of cabbage . 
from the other end of the line in Switzerland , Ion Ratiu said just keep them warm , I ' ll take a charter flight right a way and come over for dinner ! 
and this man who was living a happy life in the bosom of European bourgeois class chose to return home and expose himself to boos , disdain , threats and attempts to have his name dragged in the mud . 
early after Ceausescu 's fall , he was the target of criticism for not having stayed home to feed on soy salami like his fellow countrymen in the communist days . 
that 's true , he didn't eat soy salami . 
but together with Corneliu Coposu he did a lot of things , both good and bad , for the Christian Democratic Party ( PNTCD ) . 
he made his contribution to the consolidation of the party revived overnight . 
uncle Ratiu went on campaign trail all over the country , toured through Transylvania and enlightened the inhabitants of Turda town where his family come from . 
but despite his pretty good election campaign performance , the presidential polls in May 1990 brought him only a low number of votes . 
the leftist wave swept him a way . 
at that time nobody stood any chances of overcoming Ion Iliescu given the gross manipulation schemes and people 's mentality still under the influence of communist dogma . 
but since then Master Iancu has been dreaming on about becoming Romania 's president . 
master Iancu thinks his coming back home was pointless as long as he couldn't get the president office . 
and his deadly hatred of Emil Constantinescu dates back to that time . 
in 1992 , despite his name , his money and his experience in democracy matters , Ion Ratiu was defeated by the geology professor . 
and since that day , whenever you happen to talk with him he never misses the opportunity to say he would have made a better president . 
and he has also made it his goal to get back at Constantinescu . 
which is why " Cotidianul " newspaper since 1997 has been damning the current president sometimes even worse than Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy or Vadim Tudor 's Greater Romania Party . 
when reading the newspaper owned by Ratiu family you have the feeling that it either belongs to some hot - headed people or it is masterminded by " Romania Mare " and " Atac la persoana " weeklies . 
" Cotidianul " has carried the most unimaginable accusations against the president , with Master Iancu trying in vain to throw the blame on somebody else by saying he has nothing to do with the president smearing machine . 
as a matter of fact , the obvious animosity between Ion Ratiu and Emil Constantinescu is reflected in the political path followed by the black tie gentleman . 
though he is one of the PNTCD vicepresidents , he has slowly come to mean nothing in the party . 
he hasn't been offered an ambassador office , nor has he been appointed to some other high post , though he would deserve some compensation for the way he served the party in the early nineties . 
Ion Ratiu is now isolated in PNTCD . 
soon , the party 's Standing Bureau may turn him in to an ordinary party member . 
which would translate in to ten years of his life spent in the service of democracy and of a chimera . 
age has left Ion Ratiu without many of the attributes he used to have in his youth . 
but he still persists in his ambition and illusion that maybe someday he will become Romania 's president and I think he ' ll never stop dreaming of that . 
which is why it is possible that Ion Ratiu will migrate to another party . 
or maybe he will accept being an ordinary PNTCD member and give vent to his anger in the absurd things about Emil Constantinescu published by " Cotidianul " newspaper . 
or maybe he will go back to London leaving the house that once belonged to Dimitrie Gusti . 
who will understand Master Iancu 's tragedy and show respect for the black tie that for a while was the symbol of bygone world ? 
and who will be so forceful as to explain him that it is getting ever later ?
