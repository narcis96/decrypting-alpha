i think that God himself has serious troubles when trying to understand us . 
and finally he scratches his beard wondering what these Romanians want after all . 
and he finds no answer himself , so all the less can we do it . 
i bet that since Thursday evening Radu Vasile has been much cockier as he thinks he is a gifted politician because the arrangement with the IMF and the World Bank worked out in the last minute , as he hasn't had a moment 's doubt as to the credit that should be given to his cabinet . 
he has never admitted this to be a stroke of luck for him triggered by the Yugoslavia conflict . 
he is not the only one not to admit this . 
i bet Emil Constantinescu in his turn is facing the same risk . 
after having chosen to back NATO at the expense of reform and of Ciorbea cabinet , he is fast heading for a fateful fall . 
without the conflict in Kosovo , Romania would have been far from standing significant chances for integration with Europe and NATO . 
before this our chances were not higher than those of a flea on a stray dog run over by cars . 
but bombing raids on Yugoslavia drastically changed prospects . 
an area which otherwise would have vegetated for decades in its indefinite juice now becomes sort of a focus of attention . 
the places nobody had thought to put money in are ever more often mentioned as areas to enjoy an economic reconstruction plan . 
things that didn't even cross our minds A few months ago begin to look ever more feasible . 
a Marshall plan for the Balkans is being mentioned these days in Washington . 
and any solution to put an end to the conflict includes such a measure as the next step . 
of course this project is just a possibility and we shouldn't take it for granted before it has been tabled and embraced by the big powers . 
first they have to find a way to settle the conflict and it is only then that they will consider " compensations " for the NATO errors . 
and the operation is being carried on and it quickly develops , but the way it will end is not in sight yet . 
there will be a while before we see the Kosovo peace signed . 
anyway that Romania faces a golden opportunity really confuses us . 
we would complain , grumble , whine on the ruins of our misfortunes , blaming our history , geopolitics , our leaders . 
if by miracle we were deprived of the source of our daily pessimism , we would be able to hate he who made us choose optimism for a change . 
in this respect we are really infirm , as the desire to see others deprived of the things we don't have is embedded in our mindframe , and we want to preserve our typically Romanian whining and the pessimism which provides us the energy vital for tomorrow . 
not even the prospect of such an economic re - launch of the Balkan region , supposed to be a morale bolster , could make us abandon our misgivings and a certain cockiness . 
we have our merits , as Radu Vasile would say after the signing of the IMF letter of intent and as Emil Constantinescu is likely to say when renewed interest in the Balkans gives Romania some opportunities . 
what do I mean ? 
i mean that on the one hand we do not believe in chance ( maybe because most times we haven't been lucky ) and on the other hand we cannot smell out chance or strain to bring about strokes of luck . 
normally , instead of keeping on whining ( most of us ) and on exaggerating our cockiness ( those who struck it lucky while in power ) , we ' d better get to work and keep " bombing " international bodies with carefully - planned proposals , development plans , coherent ideas and serious approach of everything going on in Romania . 
otherwise after the end of the war in Yugoslavia and the adoption of the Marshall plan for the Balkans we will find ourselves lagging behind , with a chip on our shoulders , cursing a gain our bad luck and misfortune . 
I mean we should get to work right a way , have solid and clean institutions built up , set our stalling market economy in motion and prove we are not twenty millions of octavianpalers * suffering from the disease of bemoaning our fate at the moon eaten a way by werewolves . 
we take extreme delight in complaining and we don't even care that adverse fate may decide that Romania at a given moment experience tremendous hardships for lack of some men endowed with minimum optimism .
