much has changed in our beloved country . 
only the relief and a certain way of thinking have remained immovable . 
like the Mures river that winds through the mountains and hills and then through the plain to flow in to some place abroad , a certain practice has made its way through time , the interwar years and the decades of communism to flow somewhere in to the future . 
but unlike the Mures river that can't be turned off to run through other mountains and countries , this harmful habit has to be reversed and dammed up for ever . 
it 's about the way power is used . 
Romanians launched in to politics in order to feather their nests by burdening their fellow countrymen . 
few were the great respectable names of this country who fought with a tenacity bordering on despair to get to the top of the ladder and who once there devoted their life to put the country on a prosperous track . 
both the interwar politicians , and the communists , and our rulers nowadays have talked thirteen to the dozen and stirred the crowds with their big words only to appease their hunger for wealth , wellbeing and prosperity . 
the saddest thing is that this practice is over one century old and that politics has become a get - rich - quick " institution " . 
it has been accepted both by those who indulge themselves in this practice , and by those who let themselves be fooled . 
the latter have got used to duplicity . 
most people would do the same thing if they were " lucky " to come a cross such an opportunity . 
we are faced with a rude way of doing politics , whereas in the civilized world the politician is the honoured servant of public interest . 
and as soon as he takes a wrong step , he is penalized and sent back to being an ordinary citizen . 
moreover , these days when Great Britain is in turmoil because of a scandal involving the traffic of influence at the highest level , nearly all Romania is glad to say see , things are no different in other countries . 
instead of learning what 's important from similar situations in other places , we use them to justify the absurd state of things in the Romanian society . 
using politics to one 's personal interest pushes Romania to a dead - end situation . 
it 's a disaster we sink in to as we make great speeches . 
but with a lot of noise we improve to perfection the mafia mechanisms and make public institutions void of sense . 
what   can be done to reverse this harmful course which has become a local custom ? 
the first prerequisite is for the many people affected by this practice to change their attitude . 
when people no longer accept to be fooled in any way , when   they have the courage to protest against a mayor , a corrupt civil servant or a minister , then undoubtedly things will change dramatically . 
Romanians tolerated corruption , now they have to rise against it . 
the second prerequisite , deriving from the first , is for the country 's top figures to become the citizens ' partners . 
not by words , but by taking firm measures against the practice of getting rich through politics . 
laws are only the third condition . 
without people 's involvement and without top figures devoted to public causes , laws are nothing but futile writings with those who made them and those called on to enforce them slipping through their net . 
as long as Romanians do not realize that politicians are only fellow human beings made the honour of serving the   community interest , we have no   chance of getting out   of the situation we 're currently in . 
can the civil society and the mass media trigger   such a change ? 
how long will it take ? 
Romania 's future depends on the answer to these questions . 
one thing is sure . 
in the absence of pressure put by people , the " rakes " of today 's Romania will remain unchanged for many tens of years from now on .
