i ' m ready to bet my bottom dollar that the European Union and western governments high officials are fed up with the eastern Europe countries . 
the latter keep asking for money and spend it with no visible results . 
they pledge to proceed to various changes , but finally do nothing . 
they forward reports on progress made in a wide range of fields , but when you go check you find a complete mess . 
pitted roads , confused legislation , poor social assistance , banks stinking of dirty affairs , poisoned environment where people live like guinea pigs used to breathe even the lethal air emanated from cyanide jars . 
from time to time they jump down the ethnic minorities ' throat , they flare like gun powder and we the West have to subsidies their wars , channel heaps of money to make them reconcile and then beg them to allow us remove the devastating effects . 
the fact that the day before yesterday Romano Prodi announced in Brussels the commission recommended that the union 's summit to be held in Helsinki in December should invite other six east European states ( Romania , Bulgaria , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta and Slovakia ) to start EU admission negotiations shows us the West is about to change its strategy . 
they realized these states are unable to carry out the reform process or can make only little progress . 
and that leaving them out of the integration process only makes them vociferate and cause more troubles with the high costs entailed by them to be covered by the West . 
the measure is also an attempt to stop new nationalist hot spots to occur in the area . 
so what did the Westerners say to themselves ? 
let 's invite these unfortunates to the negotiation table ! 
let 's stop keeping them at the door on grounds that they make no progress ! 
we ' d better make them feel they are treated on equal footing , that they are part of Europe . 
but we won't allow them to sit at the table , we ' ll keep them standing and impose terms on them . 
the crease of your trousers is broken , the legislation books are missing , you lost a button on your shirt , you are not good at keeping track of your daily expenses , the shoes you bought are too expensive , you lack cheap sports footwear . 
Romano Prodi 's message is clear . 
the western Europe signals it wants us and that it 's ready to expand . 
this move is essential for Romania . 
we are given the opportunity not to be left outside the civilized world . 
but at the same time there is no guarantee that we will get EU admission . 
this depends on Romania 's desire , on the elite 's political will and on the population 's level of understanding . 
can the state institutions turn in to a sound foundation for democracy or not ? 
are we able to change our mentality ? 
the new stand adopted by the European Union transfers full responsibility to the eastern countries marked by the mental , institutional and economic handicap triggered by communism . 
are these countries able to transform themselves or not ? 
the West proves it wants these countries . 
naturally , the announcement made by Romano Prodi and the invitation to start admission negotiations that is to be extended at the Helsinki summit in December takes the wind out of the sails of that bugaboo about Transylvania breakaway and of Huntington 's theory . 
and it also means something many of us can find hard to imagine . 
it means that the Eastern borderline of united Europe will go down from the Baltic states a long the eastern frontier of Poland and Hungary to the bank of Prut river and the western coastline of the Black Sea . 
not even in their most beautiful dreams could Romanians see themselves as part of such a map . 
this map brings about a radical change in the image of our old continent which will finally be an economic and legislative community , with one single currency and a coherent political and military policy we shall be part of . 
Romano Prodi 's speech marks the setting in to motion , on paper , of the first utopian train for the long afflicted East European states . 
will this train ever be real ? 
god alone knows . 
but it is undoubtedly worth trying to grasp this unique opportunity . 
this is our chance to be no longer labelled a second - rate country . 
this is the project that will enable the future generations to be part of the world so long aspired after . 
nevertheless , the process is complicated , difficult to carry through and almost impossible to mimic . 
turning the new European mapping to good account and making it come to life calls for the nation to make a terrible effort . 
it calls for real politicians , not caricatures of politicians . 
it calls for a different way of reasoning when it comes to essential matters , for solid institutions , sound economy and clear - cut legislation . 
the announcement made by the European Commission holds out great hopes . 
it 's like an unbelievable promise , like an invitation which is both an honour and a humiliation to us . 
you wretches , we invite you to the ball , but you won't get admission and won't be allowed to dance unless you dress in white tie and behave like gentlemen !
