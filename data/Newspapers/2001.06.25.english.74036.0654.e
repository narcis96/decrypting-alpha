do you know what is striking about Ion Iliescu ? 
any man , when he has the chance to take a close look at him , is amazed at his agile walk . 
he steps briskly on his toes as if he were a lively dancer . 
the guards run after him , the hosts can barely keep pace with him and exchange surprised looks , while Ion Iliescu walks quickly as if he wasn't his age and didn't have any memories to stumble over . 
he was the same during his visit in Iasi city , quick , smartly dressed , and unpredictable . 
if we look at things on the whole , Ion Iliescu showed a gain as a still young politician , after he behaved like a pathetic old man for years . 
after he beat about the bush for so long when it came to interwar marshal Ion Antonescu , exactly when his supporters least expected it , the president of Romania changed his tune . 
he said the marshal remained a " war criminal " . 
he didn't say that even during his visit to Israel immediately after 1990 , he didn't react like that even when anti - Semitic tones started to show up in Vadim Tudor 's speeches or in the rubbishy magazines owned by his supporters . 
such a shocking statement by Ion Iliescu is made right now when the president has nothing left to lose . 
we have to emphasize that a similar gesture , that of reconciliation with the King , came during a similar period when apparently the stakes were not high . 
and the change in his opinion ( more far - going ) about private property and land - owners occurred during the same period of detachment from domestic problems . 
what could we understand from such surprise moves ? 
that Ion Iliescu is indignant at the initiative to unveil the bust of the marshal in the yard of a church ? 
that he has meanwhile re - read history books and found out another truth ? 
i doubt it ! 
Ion Iliescu rather takes a calculated and well - thought - out step in his attempt to gain international political recognition . 
after many years of hesitation , he has come to the conclusion that there is no alternative as far as the holocaust is concerned . 
if neither Switzerland nor Germany were able to reach a compromise in this matter , it cannot in the least be worked out in Bucharest . 
Ion Iliescu 's statement , made on the occasion of a wreath - laying ceremony in Iasi city , will probably have international echos . 
a former communist , now a head of state , dissociates himself from one of the historic figures of Romania , involved in the persecution of Jews . 
it is a political move which can arouse controversy even among his own supporters . 
and these , encouraged by Vadim Tudor 's nationalism , might cause hot debates . 
in order for Ion Iliescu not to remain alone in this approach , a public backing , but especially a scientific one , is necessary . 
behind the president 's statement there are terrible truths which the Romanian historians , and even the media , have avoided to make public . 
when the Romanians least expected it , Ion Iliescu got involved in settling another thorny historical issue . 
a part from all his personal sins , he must be helped .
