you know very well that there is no big difference between what a drunk man and what a politician in electoral campaign says . 
both the drunkard and the politician in electoral campaign want to look tougher and more important . 
they have the feeling that people don't give them as much attention as they deserve and then they push things too far . 
the difference is that when he gets sober , the drunkard becomes what he really is while after the electoral campaign the politician either returns to his usual discourse ( most often ) or sticks to his ideas ( as it happened to the Nazi nationalism ) . 
i say all these in order to have a better understanding of what is going on currently in Hungary . 
not everything that is stated in Budapest has to be taken for granted . 
it has to be looked at from the angle of the electoral competition . 
much noise , important promises , an excess of national pride ( as PRM leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor also did to win votes in the last November elections ) . 
against this background , the Hungarian certificate is way beyond the stage of electoral propaganda and has become a law and a subject of international dispute . 
the immediate consequence of the stake electorally increased in Hungary was a new outbreak of nationalism in Bucharest . 
a problem which seemed buried for a long time in 1996 when the bilateral treaty between Romania and Hungary was signed now reappears , and it is not necessarily the Romanians ' fault . 
the Hungarian certificate and a few less inspired statements have already made the atmosphere tense , with the Bucharest being made to exercise its appetite for statements in reply and for a popular support - bringing patriotism . 
once the tension raceis begun , each side feels obliged to pour a drop of acid on an open wound . 
and so the path to normality becomes even more difficult to take . 
in the corner of this page and by all that has published in the past years , " Evenimentul zilei " has tried not to add fuel to the flames , to keep a reasonable attitude presenting things in a calm way . 
this is the reason why we didn't give any credit either to the Romanian or Hungarian extremists . 
starting from the need for balance , we want to draw attention to the fact that the Romania v. Hungary match which is due to be played in Budapest , beyond being a sports competition , can become a pretext to inflame relations between the two countries . 
special order - keeping measures were taken when the match was played in Bucharest . 
except for whistles aimed at the Hungarian players , no major incidents occurred . 
but the organization of an anti - Romanian demonstration during the Romania v. Hungary match in Budapest seems a very dangerous move to me and a risk uselessly taken . 
a few thousands people could have gathered in Bucharest to demonstrate against Hungary as well . 
many would have liked to join it . 
but such a thing never happened . 
even if it is about an extremist organization and not the Hungarian people or government , the authorization of a demonstration to protest against the Treaty of Trianon or Romania 's policy towards ethnic minorities means to turn a sports event in to a confrontation which involves the history of both countries . 
it is as if you used the football to settle events that happened decades or centuries ago . 
a bit of madness is sufficient to turn a soccer match in to a dispute between countries , peoples and governments . 
then , the score would no longer count anyway .
