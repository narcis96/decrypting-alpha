the text resembling those of the communist - era cultural assemblies , which was issued by the Defence Ministry last week , is going around the world . 
from " Wall Street Journal " and " Washington Post " to " Financial Times " , all newspapers quote the anthological sentences of the army , which seem to hide the very neurones of minister Ioan Mircea Pascu . 
Romanians , a good humoured people , may consider the ministry 's blunder as a droll gesture . 
but in the civilised world , ministries and authorities do note make jokes and do not issue press releases in the manner of communist - era cultural assemblies . 
furthermore , an official quoted by " Financial Times " said the communiqu & eacute ; indicated a worrying way of thinking . 
what is even more sad than that is that after the release of the ideas resembling those of a simple old soldier , the ministry , the government or the presidency , instead of distancing themselves from the statements in question , chose to quibble . 
Adrian Nastase said the document was misinterpreted , Ion Iliescu said it was concerning decent relations between dignitaries and the press and minister Ioan Mircea Pascu told a lady journalist : " no comment " . 
only that the text which seemed a trifle to the Romanian authorities , an innocent joke at the most , has been and still is going around the world in a crucial moment , as the foreign ministers of NATO member states met in Reykjavik these days . 
from this point of view , Ioan Mircea Pascu may consider himself responsible for a big harm done to his country exactly when fortune seemed to smile on us . 
the defence minister , a well - known politician ( suspected , in the United States , of connections with former political police Securitate ) has though a few merits . 
he has managed to attain some remarkable achievements since he took over the Defence Ministry portfolio . 
the modernisation of different army sectors as well as our NATO entry chances can be considered the result of his efforts , as well . 
but , what 's the use of it , as long as he risks to resemble that milky but restive cow that , at the end , overturns the pot with milk . 
financial Times yesterday wrote that Romania 's hopes to join NATO were undermined by the Defence Ministry 's communiqu & eacute ; which threatened the lives of the journalists who questioned the progress made by their country towards attaining the Alliance entry goal . 
a diplomat said it was surprising to see such a communiqu & eacute ; issued in such a crucial period . 
is it likely for the Defence Ministry 's awkward text to be the accident that will cause problems to Romania during the summit in Prague ? 
if we look at the almost religious respect for the freedom of expression in the NATO member states , if we take in to account the occasion on which the stone was thrown ( a debate on Securitate officers who are still working in army structures ) , then we do have reasons to worry . 
the army 's " concern " for the journalists ' health could stir so many waves in NATO member countries so that , at a given moment , it may become an insurmountable problem . 
stubborn and ignorant of the risks he caused , minister Mircea Pascu will agree to take a step back but following potential pressure put by Ion Iliescu or Adrian Nastase . 
a retractation accompanied by apologies would be needed now more then ever . 
and if it takes too long for the peevish minister to change his stand , even his dismissal may not be enough to make up for the harm caused to Romania in point of NATO accession . 
some important newspapers write that we should no longer bother with attaining Romania 's hope to join NATO . 
because , like Defence Ministry put it , " life is short , and health is too precious to be endangered by launching debates that entail a high emotional tension and stress " . 
without having to fire a cartridge , the Romanian defence minister became famous in the alliance member states . 
not for his strategical skills or for his fight for democracy , but for his being a potential peril for it .
