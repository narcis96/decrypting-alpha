can you remember the famous scandal between Vacaroiu 's cabinet and journalist Petre Mihai Bacanu ? 
" Romania libera " daily published in 1995 an article entitled " Vacaroiu 's tankers " . 
a hideous show started back then . 
the government firmly denied , it issued releases , it even filed a complaint . 
Nicolae Vacaroiu was implying that the publication of the article was an attempt to compromise the Romanian state . 
there were reactions on the television , the General Prosecutor 's Office was notified and it seemed that " Romania libera " and Petre Mihai Bacanu were in a tight spot . 
we were even thinking that Vacaroiu wasn't so crazy as to violently deny , that we could not actually have such a two - faced cabinet chief ! 
we could not believe that he would so adamantly stick to some statements if the state of affairs was in complete contradiction to the declarations . 
moreover , during that scandal , Vacaroiu 's cabinet admitted that some diesel oil had been supplied to Yugoslavia , but not much , a few bucketfuls or tons , necessary to keep some valves working at the Iron Gate hydro - power station on the Danube . 
later afterwards there was talk of humanitarian reasons for the supply , that is the fuel was delivered to heat hospitals and kindergartens . 
after investigations by our reporters in the Jimbolia train station area , according to statements by some rail workers and employees of the SRI intelligence service or the railway transport police , things are as clear as can be . 
i for one could rather be uncertain about my birthday . 
my dad thrilled about my birth could have got a little inebriated and mistaken 14 for 15 at the registrar 's office in the commune . 
but I have not doubts about the large - scale smuggle operation carried out at the frontier with Yugoslavia . 
it is not about the embargo broken by fishermen , small - time go - getters , farmers living by the Danube river bank or petty smugglers . 
it is about a large - scale operation coordinated by authorities of the Romanian state . 
it is about dozens , maybe even hundreds , of trains having crossed the border in the dead of night . 
there were also the huge amounts of diesel oil supplied to Yugoslavia through the pipeline which connects the Timisoara - based " Solventul " chemical plant with the one in Pancevo . 
out of the witnesses statements it comes out clearly that certain Romanian authorities had a detailed knowledge of the operation . 
they both controlled and coordinated it . 
there 's one thing that we haven't managed to clearly re - trace : the cash flow . 
did the money stay at the shell companies , was it shared by the firm owners with the state representatives ? 
or did the money go to everybody 's pockets , with part of it transferred to the accounts of the secret services ? 
moreover , we are in possession of data which show that , besides the fuel , many freight cars loaded with armament were sneaked between oil product tank wagons . 
in his statement on Sunday , Ion Iliescu lied as naturally as Vacaroiu 's cabinet had when the accusations in " Romania libera " were published . 
Iliescu shifted focus on Stalin , on political - electoral reasons , but it should be mentioned that president Emil Constantinescu 's having made the assertions in question during a talk show on Antena 1 private television on electoral grounds does not make the deeds less true . 
let us not forget that former SRI head Virgil Magureanu at a given moment confirmed the existence of such operations ( " Romania broke the embargo through a decision made at the top echelons " ) . 
the fault of Emil Constantinescu and of the state institutions is their powerlessness to bring to justice those who initiated and coordinated the oil products and armament smuggle to Yugoslavia . 
there is another big unknown to the " Jimbolia " operation during the embargo , that Ion Iliescu puts to his use . 
international observers signalled no breach of the UNO resolutions . 
we have no knowledge of a report by such officials on the large - scale operation carried out through the Jimbolia rail station or through the Solventul pipeline . 
were they blind ? 
or were they such wimps that they failed to notice a thing ? 
were they bribed , too , with the dirty money from the operation ? 
or were they reserved the treatment used to soften the referees in Romania 's major international soccer matches under Ceausescu 's rule ? 
a team of officers would see to gathering a bunch of girls to handle the entertainment . 
while on the field , the referees would run in complete confusion and everything would end well . 
probably that this is how things went in the state smuggle case , too , with the international observers fully enjoying the hospitality of the female representatives of the Romanian nation while the trains loaded with fuels and armament were being transferred to Yugoslavia at night . 
the official oil products and armament smuggle is just a hideous operation . 
Ion Iliescu proved unable to bury it for good and Emil Constantinescu - equally unable to bring it to light in its entirety .
