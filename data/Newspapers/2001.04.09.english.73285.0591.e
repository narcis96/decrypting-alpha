what failed to be sold through public bids in 1991 - 1992 when Romania could have made freight trains of money in privatisation revenues was sold dirt cheap the following years . 
in fact , sort of a " natural " privatisation process occurred . 
piece by piece and asset by asset slipped from the hands of the state to the hands of some quicker grabbers closer to the then rulers . 
except for some few exceptions ( when the papers were drawn up in a visibly slapdash manner ) , all the asset transfer transactions are covered by perfectly legal papers . 
in fact , I don't think there was such a thing as a clean selloff business able to face without fear the doomsday . 
the state incurred small losses with every selloff , though Romania is full of businessmen ready to complain they put more money in a business than its worth . 
and when I say no selloff transaction has been clean , I mean both transactions concluded before and after 1996 . 
the Democratic Convention and former Romania 's president Emil Constantinescu tried to look closely in to all the big privatisation businesses from 1990 to 1996 . 
they failed to prove much , as they were hampered in their attempt by the shady selloff contracts closed under their control . 
the anti - corruption campaign aimed at showing people they were the honest ones failed lamentably . 
it 's now the PDSR 's turn to say the Democratic Convention plundered the country . 
obviously , the PDSR is no longer saying a word about all the things happened before 1996 . 
those don't count , the current ruling party seems to say . 
the sponge was passed over all of them . 
now it 's time to insist on the shady selloff contracts closed by those who in 1997 - 1998 had the courage to blame their predecessors for the same thing . 
and as people seem to have forgotten the big shady affairs the PDSR was involved in , including the oil smuggling to Yugoslavia ( controlled by people close to the party ) , all we can do now is watch the new disclosure " festival " . 
it is aimed at showing people who plundered the country . 
the answer is known . 
the Democratic Convention , undoubtedly ! 
and the knights of justice , with the party 's roses pinned to their lapels , will point their finger to all sorts of crimes , make accusations in public , proceed to make arrests and to take legal actions . 
obviously , judgements in these cases will be less important . 
prosecution will be the essential thing , and in the meanwhile other selloffs will be carried out under the management of the same knights of justice . 
and everything will be carried out in a clean manner , keeping track of every penny , milligram of gold , kilogram of iron and square meter of land . 
let 's be serious ! 
this theory can make even frozen chichen smile , not to mention the living ones ! 
neither Romanians ' inner nature , nor the PDSR 's essence will change overnight ! 
speaking from a political point of view , the carnival of dirty privatisation disclosures will help the proletariat let off steam . 
dear me , can you imagine what the former rulers did ? ! 
it 's a good job they are being busted and branded . 
people will be thrilled . 
but the state will see nothing back , except for two wheelbarrows , three brooms , an empty building and a rusty shack . 
what some may lose will be acquired by the people close to the other camp . 
they will pass from under the devil 's ownership to his brother 's . 
that 's all ! 
there is one more thing , besides the investigation that is worth running and the disclosure carnival in store for us . 
what will be the outcome of the police and the secret services involvement in the privatisation process followed by the mess triggered by cancellations , investigations and lawsuits ? 
a terrible and irreversible loss of confidence in the Romanian market ! 
this is no place for a businessman , because you can hardly reap the fruits of the business you put your money in when the other camp takes over the power and starts changing the legislation . 
and what you negotiated on is no longer valid as the fresh authorities are going to arrest you , start investigations and cancel your business contract . 
and you are going to be left to hold the sack . 
this conclusion is the reverse side of the coin . 
and it costs us as much as the plundered assets .
