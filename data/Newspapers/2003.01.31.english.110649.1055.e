another episode in the fight to take over Steaua football club took place at the end of last week . 
it seemed his opponents could have had any name . 
even Victor Becali or Viorel Paunescu or some other strategic investor , willing to gamble a huge amount of money on the name of Romania 's famous champion team . 
well , what followed came as a sheer surprise . 
Gigi Becali 's main opponent in the general meeting of Steaua Football Club Association was nobody else than George Constantin Paunescu , the notorious client of the late Bancorex and Bankcoop banks . 
certainly , George Constantin Paunescu appeared among the other people in the association a long with other members of his family . 
and a long with the latter , there were other men with Gigi Becali 's clan . 
what could possibly make the controversial businessman participate in that meeting ? 
had he turned overnight in to a fierce fan of Steaua football team ? 
or was he yet another strategic investor ? 
as far as we known , Paunescu clan 's contribution was modest and mainly consisted in accommodation and meal services at the hotels held by the family . 
that 's how the war of statements between Becali and George Constantin Paunescu started . 
the former started to question ( as if there was a need for that ) his opponent 's relationship with Bancorex . 
the latter , instead of attacking his opponent 's financial sources , made a statement which the public television aired live , as if they were announcing the beginning of the war in Iraq . 
what was it all about ? 
George Constantin Paunescu said he would produce evidence showing who the real defrauders of Bancorex bank were . 
the news caused sensation as if the promise had been made by the head of the World Bank or by monk Nifon back home after a prolonged period of reclusion in the company of a world finances saint . 
days are almost gone . 
our days as a poor country marked by emptied bankrupt banks . 
our days as kids in point of market economy , though we know all the early capitalist credits were extended only based on political connections . 
in the minds of many Romanians the hope started to bud that the Bancorex money was in some place else than we knew ( according to the list of unpaid credits transferred to the agency to recoup banking assets AVAB ) and could be recouped . 
at the same time , as we learned there was somebody ( it 's true , less credible in this case ) who knows where the money has gone , we thought the police and the prosecutors would hurry to find out another shred of truth . 
it 's not like we are talking about some change to pay a season ticket for the Titu train . 
hundreds of millions of dollars vanished from Bancorex . 
at the same time , we thought that George Constantin Paunescu , happy that he can talk now , said he knew the truth about the bank 's collapse . 
we didn't imagine he would tell us all the details right a way . 
we had to understand the man had no papers on him . 
only days went by implacably . 
and George Constantin Paunescu didn't make those statements over a poker game with Dumitru Dragomir , Victor Piturca and Viorel Paunescu . 
he made a promise on the public TV station , before lots of journalists . 
what should we infer from that ? 
that George Constantin Paunescu has the papers in Switzerland , in the safes of the Swiss companies he 's running ? 
or did he leave them in America , where he lived when he said he was in poor health ? 
or that he still has to carry out certain negotiations ? 
the last supposition makes us think that the current ruling power could think about re - launching George Constantin Paunescu , dubbed the " financial engineer " under Vacaroiu government . 
as we are curious to learn where Bancorex money is , we are looking forward to the promised explanation in a statement to the press , not to the court , to the public , not to his business partners . 
obviously , nobody could be given a sentence over such a move , not even a suspended one !
