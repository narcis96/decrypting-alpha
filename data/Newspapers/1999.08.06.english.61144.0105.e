Luciano Pavarotti 's concert in Bucharest will be one of Romania 's major musical events . 
maybe only the presence here of Von Karajan and of Placido Domingo could be compared with it in point of significance . 
we couldn't have dreamt of something more . 
classical composers are universal values , the Beatles will never be together a gain . 
so an evening with this great singer is about everything we could want , all the more since the concert is to be held on the eclipse day in front of the famous building Ceausescu erected . 
it was named the Casa Poporului ( The People 's House ) and it closes the Victoria Socialismului ( The Victory of Socialism ) boulevard that Bucharesters have been calling for years the Victory of Socialism over Bucharest . 
this nickname was also a vengeance , as it hinted at the bulidings demolished to make room for the mammoth - structure . 
five years ago , when together with Radio Total station we launched the project of this concert , we had planned it as a move in protest of the bizarre palace of megalomania , and as a requiem for the demolished houses and in the memory of those who spent their childhood in the Uranus district of the capital . 
one of the most " Bucharester " parts of the city is history . 
but there will be about the arias to be performed by Pavarotti while facing the Casa Poporului - currently the Palace of Parliament - a suggestion of protest against dictatorship , against totalitarianism , against all those years during which we used to live without our elementary freedoms . 
Ceausescu is gone , all that nonsense is fading back in a corner of our memory and we humans survive through faith , music and commitment to flourishing in liberty . 
a Pavarotti concert in 1999 's Romania is an extremely rare cultural event , but also an incredible financial adventure . 
the costs of such a celebration are huge . 
Pavarotti 's performance , the soprana , the conductor , the amplification equipment , the stage , the chairs , all this costs money . 
everything costs money , including the taxes to be paid to the Romanian state . 
from this concert , Romania 's budget earns 500,000 dollars which Romanians pay from their pocket to afford to take such a rare opportunity . 
such a concert if held in any city in the civilized world would yield profit . 
tickets are twice or three times more expensive , sponsors pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their name displayed at the event , and television broadcasting rights also cost lots of money . 
in Romania only Banca Comerciala Romana bank and Bucharest City Council provided reliable support for the concert . 
as for the rest , everybody just supervised and forwarded long lists of people who are supposed to get free invitations . 
This was done without shame and without scruples , without wondering whether their institution did something so that Romanians might enjoy such a treat . 
we are the only country in the self - styled civilized world where Pavarotti 's concert , more awaited than anywhere else , will entail losses . 
not only because of high taxes , but also because of the poverty of the music lovers and of the indifference of the authorities . 
that is why I find it a must to write down the names of those who made the concert happen , namely Mister Mihai Constantinescu with Artexim and Mister Gheorghe Fodoreanu with Visit Romania . 
it is their merit that on the evening of the last eclipse of the millennium the most important concert of the century will be held : Luciano Pavarotti with a repertoire prepared like for the Scala in Milan or the Metropolitan Garden . 
Incidentally , I should mention that Pavarotti , glad at the prospect of singing in Bucharest , chose a first - rate repertoire . 
the master will be performing his pieces celebrated around the world and particularly difficult areas , as those around him told him Romanian music lovers are highly cultured and exigent . 
there is no profit in this concert for " Evenimemtul zilei " . 
our daily just tried to promote the event , to offer its readers an extra chance to get free tickets . 
these days we will make public the results of the contest on the most beautiful letters written to Pavarotti . 
it should also be said that 100 disabled persons in wheelchairs will have access for free at this event , while 1,000 pensioners and students will buy tickets at almost symbolic prices , with access of children aged under 10 allowed only if they are with a parent . 
in today 's issue we also published an excerpt from Luciano Pavarotti 's book . 
the man who rather seems to be a divine refuge in to the world of sound tells the story of his life . 
in a few days he will show up in Bucharest . 
ave Maria !
