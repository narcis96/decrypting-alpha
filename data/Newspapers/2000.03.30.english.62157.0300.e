political parties in Romania share a common flaw . 
all party heads are either old or well past middle age . 
and they won't give up . 
they want to stay in power a little while longer . 
just a couple of months or a couple of years . 
they feel they are still fit for the job . 
and that it wouldn't hurt to bless the party with their great experience and wisdom . 
and to taste the joy of being at the helm for a little while longer . 
this holds good when it comes to the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party ( PNTCD ) , the Party of Social Democracy in Romania ( PDSR ) and the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) . 
the only one who acted like a real gentleman was the Social Democratic Party head Sergiu Cunescu . He took off his hat in a reverent farewell . 
contrary to the Christian Democratic Party and the main opposition party PDSR that display an unresisting attitude for the moment , the Liberals seem to be restless . 
shortly ago , the Liberals ' head Mircea Ionescu Quintus announced he would step down from office after the forthcoming general elections . 
but shortly after the announcement the Liberal senior got angry with his deputy Valeriu Stoica . 
as he was on a visit to Germany , the Liberal head had no idea that the party 's number two Valeriu Stoica was appointed by the Central Standing Bureau as single PNL negotiator with the rest of the parties . 
how come ? , Quintus snapped at his return home . 
if I get mad I ' ll call an extraordinary party convention and announce my candidacy for a fresh term in office ! 
and the Liberals ' head reversed the decision : Valeriu Stoica will negotiate only with the parties under the Democratic Convention umbrella , while a team approved by the Central Standing Bureau will conduct negotiations with the rest of the parties . 
the PNL head 's reaction speaks for itself about the tensions inside the party and especially about the tense relationship between the party 's president and prime vice president Valeriu Stoica . 
Mircea Ionescu Quintus is willing to withdraw from the party 's leadership , but at the same time he wants to keep his authority . 
the Liberals ' number two wants to ascend to power , but wants nobody to inquire in to his doings . 
the first elementary conclusion is that party heads rule the roost in today 's Romania . 
there is democracy , there is transparency , but the number one in the party is the decision maker . 
Mircea Ionescu Quintus wants to be both at the helm and a spectator . 
in fact , he would like a fresh term in office , without wondering about his move 's consequences on his party . 
Mircea Ionescu Quintus has been suspected of special involvement with the former political police under Ceausescu 's rule . 
the access to the Securitate files could cause him some problems , all the more since his persistent resistance to the passage of the law on granting access to the Securitate files and to the validation of the National Council to Examine Securitate Records have brought him to the limelight . 
the fact that he can't make his mind to leave the party leadership in the hands of younger Liberals will only diminish his chances to be re - elected for a fresh term in office and contribute to the party 's splitting up in two camps . 
on the other hand , Valeriu Stoica feels uncomfortable with his boss ' parental and wise style . 
and he can no longer smile at his party head 's blunders . 
in his wish to ascend to the party 's leadership , Valeriu Stoica made a mistake as huge as an elephant . 
he pushed George Padure forward as candidate for Bucharest general mayor without realizing the capital 's first district mayor was a phony rather than a politician of high caliber standing substantial chances to win the elections . 
moreover , Valeriu Stoica turned the elephant in to a whale when he consented to be the Liberals ' single negotiator with all the other parties . 
he shouldn't have accepted the assignment even if he had been God 's chosen one . 
because the fact that a large number of people get to be represented by one single man allows of suspicions . 
what will he say when holding negotiations ? 
what decisions will he make ? 
couldn't it be that Valeriu Stoica for the sake of a cabinet minister post in any government will not shy from signing an agreement with no matter who , to the detriment of the party 's interests ? 
this is the reason behind his failure to keep his single negotiator position . 
the others winced as if lashed and rushed to undermine his position . 
the common sensical rule saying one should never go alone to negotiations has been restored with Valeriu Stoica losing ground at a very inauspicious moment . 
the fact that Quintus reportedly threatened to bring Viorel Catarama back to the party is rather a prank one can think to play when being bored to death or when seeking to take revenge against someone . 
as they grow older , Romanian politicians show signs of approaching their second childhood . 
they want to play one more game , hit the ball once more , hear one more round of applause , and dream they are still in their heyday when they would dribble the ball past the rest of the players and magnificently score in the goalie 's absence . 
naturally , before a cheering crowd .
