i had a Belgian friend during Ceausescu 's days . 
he was an employee with a tourism agency that would book holidays in Romania for Belgian tourist groups . 
he would spend all his time in the mountains or at the seaside . 
and every time we met he would fill me with amazement . 
this Roby guy used to embark on countless tasks and he would never get tired . 
he would enthusiastically tell me about his negotiations with some museum officials where he planned to take his tourists , about making arrangements for some folk entertainment shows , he would speak about vouchers , flight arrangements , he would hastily sip his coffee and say he had to go to the railway station at midnight to welcome some tourists or that he needed a doctor to see an old lady from Belgium who was vacationing in Poiana Brasov . 
my pal 's energy was annoying . 
even at three o ' clock in the morning his bearings would keep working and he wouldn't put up the shutters , whereas I kept yawning as I was overcome by boredom . 
every day I would arrive late at the editorial office and try hard to fabricate thousands of tricks in order to avoid work . 
the bag trick proved to be the most efficient . 
i even talked the cleaning woman in to helping me , all the more since she too was in search for some skip - work or easy money schemes . 
and in exchange for a small weekly gift , Mrs Mariana every day would take a bag I kept in my desk drawer and place it on my desk with a cheap ball pen atop of it . 
for some months I could get to work any time I wanted , because I could claim that in fact I had been missing " only for a couple of minutes " . 
at around two o ' clock I would start to feel sleepy and tired and I would make myself scarce while Mrs Mariana would take my bag and put it in my desk drawer at the end of the work hours . 
in order to get a way with my scheme I had to come up with a scoop or a hot story at least once a month . 
but despite my skip - work tricks , I would feel tired all the time and tremendously bored , whereas my Belgian friend would thumb his nose at militia men and communist party activists , as he was always on the go , planning something and almost bursting with the pride of being a money - making free man . 
but what I found most annoying was the fact that he considered me a sick animal , which caused me a complex that was driving me nuts . 
then 1989 came and we went in to the press business . 
wake up at seven o ' clock in the morning , a sandwich for lunch and hard work till late hours . 
a terrible fear of going bankrupt and becoming everybody 's laughing stock was driving us at turbojet speed . 
the first time when my Belgian friend came to Bucharest after 1989 we only spoke on the phone . 
i had no spare time any longer . 
the second time I told him we could meet about midnight . 
are you nuts ? , he said . 
i go work tomorrow . 
so what ? 
i usually get home around 2 a.m. and I work Sundays too ! 
he came over , we exchanged courtesies and both went back to our business . 
the third time I told him to come over to a printing plant . 
and that time he asked me what 's the matter with you ? 
years ago you would get exhausted by doing nothing . 
now you can't stop working . 
if I stop I ' m lost . 
i lose everything and end up being everybody 's laughing stock . 
it suits you , he said . 
you have your own business . 
i ' m just an employee and I set myself limits . 
it 's your business , I said . 
i have to put a mechanism in motion . 
and he said you 're kidding yourself . 
things will never go the way you want and the only way you ' ll leave the company will be in a casket . 
it wouldn't hurt to slow down . 
and that moment I realized we had swapped roles . 
he was looking at me in amazement and I was paying through the nose the tribute for skipping work during the socialist years . 
he had discovered work with all the liberties accompanying it . 
now he couldn't stand seeing the same thing at higher standards that made him experience a feeling of discomfort , if not humiliation . 
last year when we met a gain I felt something even more painful . 
my friend from Belgium hates me . 
i was the reflection of his defeat in the years after 1990 . 
he couldn't admit his failure , the fact that his work was making him sick and that it didn't bring him any joy or other advantages any more . 
my relation with the Belgian guy followed the invisible route of our attitude towards work . 
i was on the way to discover the value of work , whereas my pal was taking distance from it . 
but there is something more to this variable - temperature friendship . 
I came to understand those who get tired and grow pessimistic because of a job that brings them almost nothing . 
in fact , this is the tragedy in the lives of millions of Romanians . 
they haven't been lucky enough to have a fully rewarding job . 
in fact , they haven't discovered the value of work as yet . 
and they can't even imagine how much it would change their lives .
