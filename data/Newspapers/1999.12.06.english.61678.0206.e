the atrocities and sexual abuses occurred in the northern town of Suceava have come as a shock to the nation . 
people are appalled . 
Romanians haven't been faced with such a case for some decades . 
and the public hasn't experienced such strong feelings since the panic stirred by Rimaru 's case in Bucharest and the hammer killer in Cluj . 
some time ago , Belgium went through a similar situation that made the headlines for one whole year . 
the passionate reactions to the horrible crimes have already gone beyond normalcy . 
some rushed to demand that death penalty be restored or that the killer be lynched . 
we face the danger of letting ourselves gripped by hysteria , of losing control and sense of balance as hearing of further victims would make us fly in to a paaion . 
usually , such happenings trigger terrible social pressure , but reactions shortly fade a way . 
the violence in Suceava is the result of a large - scale accident . 
we undoubtedly deal here with a mentally ill person . 
identifying and nailing down the aggressor become vital both for the community in Suceava and for authorities . 
but the gravity of what happens in Suceava should not hamper us from discerning the essence of things . 
sexual abuses , and not only , are an issue ignored by authorities , families and civic society . 
overcome with the high criminality rate , police seem not to know where to start from in curbing the plague . 
should they focus on homicides , white collar crime or child abuses ? 
in addition , the identification of sexual abuses is obstructed because of people 's prudishness when it comes to sex - related matters . 
that 's how we ' ve come not to know the real dimension of this phenomenon . 
the fact that mass media abroad start to link Romania to the idea of a paedophile haven should be regarded as an alarm signal . 
the same goes with Romanian institutionalized children mentioned in European Union reports , which should make us admit we are no longer faced with an outrageous accident , but with a situation with multiple causes . 
Romanians have got used to bump in to street children , without wondering what 's going on with these children . 
but it shocks them learning that most of these children are sexually active , though most of them are in the 7 to 12 years age bracket . 
since Ceausescu 's days , Romanians have got used not to look out that much for their children . 
many of them are most of the time alone at home and have to look after themselves , and nobody bothers to ask them about things happening to them . 
prudishness in talking about sex drives many people to keep silent on sexual abuses . 
but none of these things can be eliminated by restoring death penalty or by displaying demagogical indignation . 
critical situations such as the current one in Suceava may occur a gain in the future here in Romania or some other place around the world . 
mentally deranged people that fail to be exposed as soon as their first crime have occurred and will continue to occur even in the civilized world . 
but it would be much more useful to try eliminate the dross and the details related to this unfortunate situation in order to get to the deep roots of the phenomenon which should be approached in light of preventive measures . 
it 's hard to build up a mechanism to prevent the occurrence of such a psycho , but rediscovering children 's long neglected cause takes on fresh urgency . 
we should involve in offering them protection , with state authorities and civic society having to take charge of the street children phenomenon . 
the tragedy of the four children in Suceava ( their number may even be higher ) has made many parents reconsider the education and care for their children . 
the tragedy has also reminded us of this phenomenon ignored for so many years . 
Engrossed in politics and everyday 's problems , we have ignored abuses children fall victims or are exposed to . 
still , nothing will be solved if this tragedy is reduced to a dispute over the punishment that should be enforced on the aggressor . 
but if we now join hands and firmly approach this issue we can hope that some day the number of children exposed to all sorts of abuses will drastically go down . 
and it is only then that we ' ll be entitled to say we ' ve done everything we were supposed to do .
