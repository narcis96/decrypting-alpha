" if that happened in my town Craiova , I ' d show no mercy and put a way none of them , I ' d shoot them all " , says a fellow with gravel in his head speaking about journalists . 
let 's read that statement more carefully . 
this cracked fellow says " if that happened in my town Craiova " . 
what does that mean ? 
that in Craiova he 's sort of a king . 
he rules the roost . 
he is the master of the town . 
he can do whatever he pleases . 
and if he gets mad , why shoot only the journalists ? 
he can take all political parties ' members and cuff them . 
if he drinks one glass too many , he shoots them too . 
and finally when there is no one left to shoot but he wants to have some good time , he starts shooting people on the streets as if shooting crows . 
you ' ll probably say who could say such an absurd thing ? 
don't worry . 
he 's not a patient committed to a mental hospital . 
he 's the main shareholder in Universitatea Craiova football club . 
he 's name is Gigi Netoiu , lately called a " football man " . 
what an error ! 
Gigi Netoiu was a patrol militiaman under Ceausescu 's rule . 
he made his way to the famous police " eavesdrop " unit nicknamed " two and a quarter " . 
only that instead of gathering intelligence , Gigi Netoiu engaged heavily in smuggling operations . 
one of his shipments consisting of about 13 lorries carrying beer bottles and I don't know how many lorries carrying cigarettes was intercepted in Branesti Forest while the merchandise was undervalued to evade legal taxes , and everybody got a way with it unscathed . 
taking advantage of his rank and of the fact that he was a police official , he developed the cigarette , coffee , alcohol and beer smuggling operations , with his and his concubine 's companies being champions in tax restitution . 
it 's enough to take a look at the lists of the 1996 polls sponsors . 
Netoiu 's and Madame Joitica 's fat companies are listed as PDSR ( Ion Iliescu 's party ) sponsors . 
you certainly realize how much smuggling money went to finance the then election campaign . 
and this militiaman with a goose brain expanded his businesses , and later became an alcohol producer , football player agent and finally the main shareholder in Universitatea football club . 
not long ago , Netoiu 's " black " network extended at Vincon company in Focsani . 
you know how it worked ? 
like clockwork ! 
he acquired a company that was debt - ridden , but had a large stock of wine . 
he sold the wine , made a profit , and now the policeman 's concubine moves in the circle of the most prominent ladies in Romania trying to get the state to buy back the distillery and the wine barrels . 
that 's where the shoe pinches ! 
some money spinner and his concubine wormed their way in to the entourage of the country 's top figures trying to make the most of it . 
but he wants more than money . 
he wants to make order in the country according to Vadim bin Laden 's principles . 
he wants to shoot the journalists , should Romania someday become sort of a " my town , Craiova " place . 
and then , like any boor once in power , he would put a way all those standing up against him and Madame Joitica . 
Craiova and the local football , as well as the rest of the country have got really low considering that a former militia man with just a couple of neurons , but a lot of nerve has managed to climb up the ladder to sit next to the nation 's top political figures and then issue directions on the enforcement of freedom . 
god forbid , not to say more !
