Gogu from Calafat town , the seed seller in Matache open market , me or you would equally easily become multimillionaires in dollars provided the government handed us out three factories or the capital city mayor Traian Basescu gave us the Herastrau Park in return for a plot of weedy land . 
we would quickly share out the park in plots fit to be sold to construction companies or to the newly rich . 
what we bought for a dollar ( in return for the weedy land handed over to the state in compensation ) we would sell for one hundred or two hundred dollars . 
wouldn't we be multimillionaires in dollars ? 
and if we had all the papers to cover up the fraud , we would brag about our achievement and say man , aren't we big businessmen ? ! 
let others do the same thing ! 
i saw erudite Becali , main sponsor of Steaua football club , on a TV broadcast . 
well - made as he is , Gigi Becali looks like a businessman until he starts speaking . 
three words later , bad grammar comes out of his mouth like some soccer ball bouncing over and over against a concrete wall . 
seven words later , Becali loses the thread of his discourse and starts gaggling , pursing his lips like a businessman with a brainache . 
he looks like a man who thinks , but is unable to put his thoughts in to words . 
finally , he puffs as he rushes to give utterance to his words , angry with the Romanian language that plays him a bad trick and with the fact that the process of thinking needs an ingredient that 's scarce on the market : good reason . 
Gigi Becali is a businessman as much as my dog is an astronaut . 
he presses whatever buttons are closest to him without knowing what the consequences of his act may be , or where the connections are being made and especially on what principles do they work . 
George Becali also called Gigi , " main sponsor of Steaua football club " ( sort of a fourth - grader academician in football matters ) , made a deal that entitles him to think he 's smart . 
he handed over to the Defence Ministry some weedy plots of land and got in return some plots in Baneasa area . 
he traded bran for gold . 
he traded some weedy land for a residential area . 
exactly like his cousin Giovanni Becali . 
the latter bought land from farmers for dirty cheap money , because farmers had no idea of the land 's worth , and now he 's selling them for a price one hundred times higher . 
is he a landlord ? 
is he a Romanian businessman ? 
a gipsy living in Ferentari neighbourhood could also brag that he 's a businessman if he was making such a big time dirty deal . 
unlike the other Becali who made a smart deal and bought land from farmers ( he cheated them , and all they can do now is cry over their empty pockets ) , Gigi Becali took land owned by the Defence Ministry . 
that is by the Romanian state . 
he traded straw for real estate worth a sack full of money . 
and he did that after getting all sorts of signed papers and approvals . 
" the work " was okayed by former defence minister Victor Babiuc and general Gheorghe Bucse ( do you remember who the latter is ? 
the general escaped arrest by a hair 's breadth in connection with the " Tigareta II " cigarette smuggling case ) . 
do you know what the most outrageous thing is ? 
that Becali , also called " broken tongue " , managed to have the land transaction debated by the Supreme Defence Council ( CSAT ) . 
people who claim to be serious , innocent , and dry like a goose ( both feathers and heads ) gave approvals for a fraud of unimaginable proportions . 
and nobody bothers to put them under investigations or call them to make official statements . 
moreover , the current power said we will conduct investigations , make a report and identify the guilty ! 
yes , sure ! 
Becali will go and by using his hand , or foot , or shoulder , he ' ll explain in an intelligent way how advantageous his deal is to the state , the rulers will say yes , Mr businessman and investor in Steaua football club , and then drop the matter . 
and things will remain unchanged . 
Giga - big time businessman !
