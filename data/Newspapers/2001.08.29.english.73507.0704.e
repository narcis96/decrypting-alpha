the Prime Minister surely knew how to answer the federalists ! 
they should mind their own business ! 
he should tell them a few things in their face and set the police against them ! 
these would be the first reactions of the citizens and the press . 
but , before showing our anger , we should examine Adrian Nastase 's statements a bit . 
what happened ? 
in the past two or three weeks while the premier was on vacation , have the followers of some ideas detrimental to Romania 's integrity met somewhere in the mountains , at the seaside or in a cave to discuss their organization ? 
i haven't heard of such a thing ! 
the only concrete signal was that launched by Madalin Voicu . 
the day before yesterday , Madalin Voicu said , starting from the current disputes between foundations and organizations of Rroma , that there is a plan to destabilize the Rroma ethnic minority and federalize the country . 
that is , the arguments between Rroma might lead to the division of the Romanian territory . 
and so we returned to the times of " Tiganiada " ( Gypsyad - a Gypsy epic poem ) by Ion Budai - Deleanu . 
this might be an alarming piece of news , though it could be seen as a good joke . 
then , why did the Prime Minister get angry because of " transylvanization " and transethnic parties ? 
as far as I can remember , the idea of a transethnic party was launched many months ago . 
we reported the item of news then and we commented on it right in the corner of this page . 
nobody reacted and the idea of a transethnic party had a very short life . 
it had as many supporters as members of a literary circle . 
but , still there must be something about it . 
if the premier of a country with almost 23 million people and an area of 237,500 square metres sounds the alarm , this means he knows something . 
he doesn't speak in vain . 
has he got evidence , files , witnesses about institutions which spend money to contribute to Romania 's division ? 
and if he knows all about it , it means that he 's got in his pocket the paper with he measures he wants to take or has just taken ? 
well , things are a bit difficult from here on ! 
the premier has not announced any measures . 
and if he doesn't present any measures in the forthcoming days it means the danger is not that big , but a bit smaller . 
that is , it 's theoretical , possible , essay - like , and was perceived from the tensions in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . 
from here to the trumpet - like character is but a step . 
a trumpet that sounded in Tirgu Mures in 1990 , a trumpet also played by Corneliu Vadim Tudor , accompanied by Gheorghe Funar on the drums . 
this trumpet was also used by former president Emil Constantinescu about two years ago when he flew at the letter of some Transylvanian intellectuals , about which he subsequently found out , that it not actually signed by them . 
trying to understand what these threats are about , we remember that many years ago , when late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had a problem with the Romanians ' morale , he used to play the trumpet on the " the Russians are coming " tune . 
the nation then turned in to a concrete block and forgot about everything else . 
" the patriotic song " played by Adrian Nastase at Slanic Moldova is a bit more in tune than Vadim Tudor 's trombone . 
it is a sort of fuss , done in a more stylish way , but with no practical consequences . 
normally , if the danger were real , Adrian Nastase , having all the legal prerogatives , should fight federalization . 
or he could make Romania function like a clock so that no federalist may have wild dream . 
as he doesn't know what to do , he only fights with his trumpet , thus increasing the number of accidental nationalists . 
i even wonder if the Prime Minister and the executive , with every idle talk and with every thing undone or slapdash , somehow subscribe to the federalists ? 
is not every indecision , incoherence , and stumble of the rulers in Bucharest a gain for the other side ?
