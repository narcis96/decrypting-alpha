an individual can be defined by the sparkle in his eyes , and also by his hands , his brow and the look on his face . 
all we have is carrying signs and meanings . 
at the moment when a person appears before the others , the infinite reading begins . 
some people are able to read only a page or two of the nature of a person , with details slipping their attention , the kind of details which are only perceptible to those who have the flair or are familiar with understanding the diversity of the human behavior . 
most people judge their fellows only on their acts and language . 
only few have the ability to go beyond this aspect and , for them , a simple gesture is enough to induce that an individual will say or do something specific . 
and most often , they are looked at skeptically when explaining to the others what they understood from the development of facts . 
no matter how hard we try to explain to the people a truth that has not become plain or clear to the sight or understanding , they will still prefer to wait until the moment when all becomes palpable . 
they sometimes continue to doubt and hope to have got it all wrong , but the delay often turns out to have dramatic consequences . 
now let us go back to the language issue . 
how can we tell good will and truth from lies and manipulatory intentions in the discourse of a politician ? 
we will not focus on those individuals who can tell on the configuration of one 's nose or the way he curls his lips that A certain Mr. Jones is about to tell a lie . 
these people are few and they cannot have too much influence on the public opinion . 
general opinions are formed based on syntagms said or written and repeated over and over . 
this is the point where infinite begins , like a toy reflected in hundreds , thousands and even millions of mirrors , with each mirror casting back a different image . 
during the communist regime , a sentence said or written carried an unique , compulsory sense . 
nowadays , lacking the experience in tricks , with people coming from nowhere and about whom we know very little , an utterance can be an aberration with positive consequences , as it can turn out to be a plain , simple truth but having no impact on the people who are listening . 
in a society which begins to build up its standards , communication passes through all stages since the beginning of the human race , from the primitive communication trough signs to the major manipulations in the history . 
and the discerning ability is gained only after experiencing failures , as well as deceptions and machinations . 
we should not forget that in February and March 1990 up to three quarters of Romania 's population believed , and even used to utter loudly that " we won't sell our country " , though this was exactly what the East European countries were doing . 
ten years have passed since then and we still did not manage to get over this slogan . 
there are still 30 or 40 percent of Romanians who consider that privatization is a misfortune . 
the " change " slogan had a great impact as it included the hope . 
the desire of a change needed to be experienced and to become palpable for us to conclude that the change was not what we expected it to be . 
under the circumstances , how could we protect ourselves from the words that misled us so many times and continue to hail on all of us ? 
what should we infer from Mugurel Vintila 's assertion that Varujan Vosganian was " an Armenian cuckoo showing Nazi tendencies " ? 
or from Adrian Nastase 's allegation on Emil Constantinescu 's " dictatorial presidency " ? 
and how should we judge the statement of Ovidiu Musetescu , another member of the Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) , who said that Constantinescu regime was " similar to Lukashenko 's regime in Belarus , or to Papa Doc 's regime in Haiti , or even to Noriega 's regime in Panama " ? 
are all these true or are they only soap bubbles , such as " the change " , the " we - won't - sell - our - country " slogan , the " plenty - of - cheap - food - for - all - the - people " slogan launched by Virgil Magureanu or even " the change of the change " initiated by PDSR and that we still wait to experience so that we could cry , as in Tudor Arghezi 's poem , " I believe " or " I don't believe " . 
eventually , all we have is the mechanism of the logic . 
did all the politicians named above ever made any inconsequential statement of this kind ? 
obviously , yes . 
Mugurel Vintila , as well as Ovidiu Musetescu , Adrian Nastase and even Ion Iliescu and Emil Constantinescu left behind plenty of empty words . 
which proves at least one thing . 
all the above - mentioned politicians used to speak more than think . 
let us suppose that all their latest statements will not turn out to be meaningless . 
how could we put their words to the test ? 
once a gain , what we have is logic . 
what " Nazi tendencies " has Varujan Vosganian ever showed ? 
we don't need any finger to count these tendencies , simply because there weren't any . 
what does nowadays ' Romania have to do with Papa Doc 's Haiti or Noriega 's Panama ? 
maybe some kind of confusion , but this is not at all the case of dictatorial presidency . 
logic forces us to admit that too many people within the state institutions do foolish things , rather than to fear a presidential scourge controlling everything . 
if today 's rule in Romania was a presidential dictatorship , than other countries I prefer not no name , but which are essentially communist countries , could be considered as falling in to the category of the herds of cattle firmly tended by high - ranking cowboys . 
it is useless to strive to follow the argument , as common sense forces us to return to our first issue , which is the discourse . 
are we witnessing a decline in the quality of the discourse ? 
if this is the case , then which could be the reasons ? 
and why are all distortions tending toward the idea of dictatorship ? 
could be dictatorship seen as the most serious danger in nowadays ' Romania or is it the sole story Romanians are still likely to buy , considering they are still haunted by Ceausescu 's ghost ? 
Exertion of power in Romania has plenty of shortcomings , namely a catastrophic economy , corruption , perverted institutions lacking high standards and abounding with inconsistent laws . 
it takes a lot of education , skills , brains and strength to correct all this . 
both Emil Constantinescu and Radu Vasile can be crushed by using evidence and logic . 
however , speculations over the facts of language and converting the language in illogical significations are preferred . 
the incoherent discourse is a trap for both the politicians and the people . 
we will have to wait and see who will eventually be caught in the trap . 
those who are pointed at or the ones who believe that any allegation that is uttered or written down has the value of a political judgment .
