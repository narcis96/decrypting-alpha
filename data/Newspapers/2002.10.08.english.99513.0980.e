considering the troubles Romania is faced with , the following is the last thing that we needed . 
a law to stipulate that all texts written or spoken in foreign languages on Romania 's territory shall be translated in to Romanian . 
as other subjects that caused damage to a certain sort of Romanian " pride " ( in the sense of the word before 1989 ) stirred heated debates and consumed time , money and nerves , we can assume that this bill that has reached the stage of mediation by the two chambers of the parliament will also trigger not only squabbles and egotistic outbursts , but a " historic " fuss as well . 
some decades ago , the great Swedish linguist Alf Lombard said that Romanian is one of the world 's most flexible languages . 
it has the greatest capacity of absorbing and adapting words belonging to other languages . 
as college students we were told that some prestigious scholars ( not petty scholars like George Pruteanu ) held the opinion that grace to that particular characteristic the Romanian language stood high chances of becoming a communication means of the future . 
these assertions made in our linguistics course came back to me every time I noticed that Romanians were absorbing or adapting a great deal of words from all sorts of languages without translating them . 
that 's what happened with words like manager , trend , implementation , groggy , stand by , all the IT notions ( hard and soft ) and thousands of other words . 
Cosmopolitans or specialized language concerned with the advertising business , for example , have reached the stage of borrowing less common words . 
an ordinary person listening to a conversation between two people working on the stock exchange or in advertising or with a law firm specialized in commercial law won't make head or tail of it . 
you could say you 're listening to some gibberish - Romanian language . 
but this is not the business of the law initiated and promoted by George Pruteanu and passed by the two chambers with different provisions . 
Pruteanu and the MPs want any text or name of an institution to be translated in to Romanian . 
that 's where the circus show starts . 
do you know how much it would cost Unirea Shopping Center to re - name itself Centrul Comercial Unirea ? 
the amount of money is hard to estimate . 
the sign on the building , the company 's special printed papers , the visiting cards , the re - painting of company 's inscribed cars , the billboards placed all over Bucharest etc. 
besides , we should take in to account the billions of lei invested in advertising campaigns to make the name of this big shopping center known to the public . 
as it is registered as a company and is a trademark approved by a judge in compliance with the Romanian laws in force at the time of its registration , George Pruteanu and other two trumpet blowers can't come now to impose a translation in to Romanian . 
this would be tantamount to squandering money and would go against elementary logical thinking . 
with his academic horse figure hidden behind his spectacles , George Pruteanu said that " pizza " shouldn't be translated in to Romanian . 
why ? 
because it is a word everybody is familiar with and it was entered as such in dictionaries . 
only that the word " pita " is also used in Romanian . 
and neither Pruteanu , nor the parliament and the Romanian Academy do know which form the Romanian language will prefer . 
the Romanian language is a living , perpetually changing body which the parliament cannot control through overseers and committees . 
but there is something else that could be done . 
as the language evolves , the Romanian Academy could issue new language standards to be imposed on future student generations through linguists in universities and in Romanian language classes . 
the translation of companies ' names in to Romanian would be the greatest source of nonsense . 
LukOil or Marshal Tourism translated by Pruteanu could lead to a situation similar to that created by the excessive moves of the Blaj Latin School and would block the Romanian language renewal process . 
but neither the parliament , nor the Romanian Academy , much less the scatter - brained senator , can do such a thing . 
what would the latter say if the opposition were to initiate a law to ban all Romanian language interjections and onomatopoeic words that sound bad ? 
the word Pruteanu would disappear as well , as it starts with prrrr !
