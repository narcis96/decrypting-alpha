the situation at the first division soccer club Universitatea Craiova is one of the many aberrant things that have happened in the Romanian soccer in the past years . 
Gigi Netoiu , a former militia man who then became a smuggler , has managed to give the impression that he is a businessman and , besides running shady privatizations and cigarette and alcohol business , he also took over Universitatea Craiova . 
the Becali brothers , from hard currency dealers turned in to procurators . 
the ridiculous Dumitru Dragomir , from a former convict and adventurer , took up an MP seat and is the head of the Professional Soccer League ( LPF ) . 
a man from the police who used to cover up the cigarette and alcohol smuggling affairs now calls the shots at Universitatea Craiova , one of the first four soccer teams of Romania . 
Universitatea Craiova , controlled by a group of interests in the area , was first taken over by the Paunescu brothers , then by the king of margarine , then by Gigi Netoiu , and furthermore Adrian Paunescu , after he was washed down with a hose off the spits he got in the University Square and was politically reconditioned , also became a sort of tutor of the same great team . 
but all this gang who has persistently tried to cling to the pathetic feelings of the Craiova fans forgets one thing . 
that , besides being a business , Universitatea Craiova is also a social phenomenon . 
a long the years , an affection formed between this soccer club and millions of Romanians which cannot be treated like smuggled cigarettes and illegally produced alcohol . 
Universitatea Craiova , with all its glorious past and all its hesitations in the past few years , is part of Romania 's public life , of the Craiova city 's image and the identity of this community . 
it cannot be moved to Bucharest , as Rapid Bucharest cannot be moved to Carei or Tecuci . 
only in the minds of some geese or frogs , the carnival in Rio de Janeiro could be moved toDragasani , and Universitatea Craiova to Bucharest . 
this soccer team does not belong to Bucharest people , or to those living in Moldavia , and it belongs to Netoiu only as business . 
but as a business , the owners of Juventus Torino and Real Madrid teams , not even in the least inspired moments of their lives , wouldn't think to move the famous soccer teams to other towns . 
they would defy the respective communities , and their gesture would mean the end of their careers . 
last year , Hagi rose against the soccer Cooperative ( the mafia in the first division ) . 
not many followed him . 
now , the Craiova fans have taken to the streets to protest against Gigi Netoiu . 
it is actually a public reaction against a man who is part of the same cesspool of some soccer club presidents . 
maybe this will lead to the end of the Cooperative and its sinister leader , Dumitru Dragomir . 
not long ago , this impertinent and big - mouthed scatterbrain said that all great athletes in the world take " candies " . 
nobody had anything to say against this . 
the other day , the same second - rate character supported Netoiu 's decision to move Universitatea Craiova to Bucharest . 
Dumitru Dragomir believed that to history and the feelings of a city he can apply I - don't - know - what article in I - don't - know - what regulations . 
Netoiu 's aberrant decision and the revolt of the Craiova fans could raise the last curtain on the mafia ruling the Romanian soccer .
