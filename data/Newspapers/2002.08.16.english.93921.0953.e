though I didn't mean to , I offended many former political prisoners . 
i expressed my opinion on the setting up of a monument to celebrate the anti - communist fight in Piata Scinteii ( Scinteia Square ) , currently called Piata Presei ( Press Square ) on the same pedestal from where Lenin used to point to the future with his hand covered in pigeon droppings . 
in my editorial on July 22 headlined " Monument dedicated to an illusion " I wrote that the place and the building itself ( the Press House ) , as well as the people who used to work there did not deserve such a monument . 
they think that erecting the statue in the place most poisonous to free thinking is a revenge after such a long time . 
the monument in Piata Presei to commemorate the anti - communist fight has a polemic meaning and the value of a retribution over time . 
this too is a viewpoint that has to be respected . 
at the same time , raising this monument in a time when all the power is in the hands of those who used to cultivate contempt for the anti - communist fighters ' ideals seems to me inappropriate , if not offensive . 
considering Razvan Theodorescu 's questionable performance , there would be a hit rather too thick to see him pinning to his lapel a flower symbolizing the sacrifices made by some upright people . 
that 's a bit too thick ! 
that 's awfully ridiculous ! 
but there 's an objection that could be raised against this sort of judgement . 
the political prisoners say the monument is much more important than the name of the person who okayed it . 
its cost won't be borne by that person , but by everybody else . 
and then , years later , who will remember who was the culture minister or the premier at the time the statue was set up ? 
after all , this viewpoint too holds water , though I stick to my opinion that a well done thing from the beginning to the end can't be either mixed with shady characters or done by halves . 
anyway , I have no reason to take back or regret what I said as far as the above - mentioned things are concerned . 
my mistake was somewhere else . 
in my article I wrote that in Bucharest there had been no rebellion like the ones in Valea Jiului coalfield or in Brasov town . 
in a way , it could be understood that Bucharest had never seen an anti - communist movement , that the city on Dimbovita river banks did nothing but somehow put up with various political regimes . 
many former political prisoners felt offended . 
the article " Monument dedicated to an illusion " committed a wrong against all that had happened in Bucharest after 1945 . 
the communist jails were packed with professors , students and politicians from Bucharest . 
the resistance movement in the mountains was co - ordinated by people from the capital city . 
the hundreds of thousands of political prisoners tried to put an obstacle in the way of communism . 
they were crushed one by one , jailed , tortured , some of them buried inside penitentiaries . 
they are our only excuse before history . 
the fact they they didn't make it is a matter pertaining to the others , to a history bargain and the complicity of our fellow countrymen who came to terms with the regime . 
we owe respect to all the brave people who lived the tough days of the anti - communist fight . 
and I owe them apologies for the ambiguity of my article called " Monument dedicated to an illusion " . 
i stick to my opinions regarding the location of the statue in front of Casa Scinteii building , the monument 's cost and the opportunity offered to Razvan Theodorescu and his bosses . 
but I ' ve never meant to show the slightest shadow of contempt for these brave people , the only ones who opposed the system . 
we owe them a great deal of respect . 
and the monument helps us not to lose our dignity .
