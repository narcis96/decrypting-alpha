it 's in vain that we have repeatedly written in " Evenimentul zilei " that the " Supliciu " sculpture by Constantin Brancusi is not worth half a million dollars . 
Ion Caramitru , in order to show what a great patriot and diligent culture minister he was , did his best to see the government pay this huge sum . 
that is why he set up an appraisal commission and made use of the names of its outstanding members , by thinking this will help the price carry weight , despite the fact that after thorough inquires such a sum could not be reached . 
the papers were drawn up , the appearances of a great deal created , but the acquisition still seems fishy . 
not because plans are to bring home another work by Constantin Brancusi , far be it from me to mean this , as little as an extra picture is precious . 
but not if bought for hundreds or millions of dollars . 
the file on the " Supliciu " statue acquisition may have all the needed papers , from Gaesti to the Pope , we will still try to prove the petty minister that his feat is dubious and a circumstantial cultural pursuit . 
furthermore , we even keep suspicions that the work was overvalued for who knows what reasons and is to bring joy to who knows who . 
in order to show us that a Romanian politician will not exceed a certain condition , no matter if he comes from the world of theatre or art history , culture minister Razvan Tedorescu ( alongside with president Ion Iliescu and premier Adrian Nastase ) took the lead of the " Brancusi Year " ( as if he had the great sculptor enrolled with the ruling party PDSR ) and announced he would buy any other work . 
and to show his diligence and love for Brancusi 's work he already announced the acquisition of a " Bust of a Boy " for a price that Romanians could accept out of patriotism . 
but this sum can only trigger the smile of art collectors and specialists . 
it is a gain an inflated price . 
is it inflated just out of love for Brancusi , is it inflated just because Nastase 's cabinet has money and nothing to sped it on ? 
or is it that the price announced by Razvan Teodorescu for the " Bust of a Boy " is higher for the same reasons that were at work in case of the " Supliciu " statue ? 
the fact that these works were also offered to other art collectors for much lower sums makes us think this time , too , of possible backstage arrangements . 
is Razvan Teodorescu an expert in sculpture prices ? 
are they specialists , those who initialled the minutes of the Acquisition commission set up by Ion Caramitru ? 
no way ! 
the commission members are specialists working at museums , art critics , but novices when it comes to dealings on the art market . 
what is it that bothers us ? 
it is not the " Brancusi Year " , but the putting to use of this event to channel public money to various destinations with no control or good cause . 
maybe tomorrow a letter by poet Mihai Eminescu will be bought for one million dollars , or a hat of playwright Ion Luca Caragiale for five hundred thousand Swiss francs so on . 
Romanians , out of respect for their classics , will not comment . 
but something else actually hides behind this trade in feelings and patrimony assets . 
and if former premier Mugur Isarescu and ex - finance minister Decebal Traian Remes did the stupid thing to allow themselves to be duped by Ion Caramitru ( unless they knew something more about the acquisition terms themselves ) , why would Adrian Nastase and Ion Iliescu allow Razvan Teodorescu to do the same ( cannot it be that they know something more , too ? 
) the " Brancusi Year " is a good occasion to make known a titan of the Romanian and world culture . 
maybe like this we will no longer have fellow Romanians that will steal the ark of the church the master founded . 
but at the same time this cannot be a pretext for unjustified expenses , unless Brancusi was enrolled with the PDSR and we ignore it . 
if so , Nastase 's cabinet can offer even one million dollars for an adze from Brancusi 's studio in Paris , nearby the Georges Pompidou Centre . 
if so , it 's worth the money ! 
and Caragiale should be enrolled with the same party in his turn !
