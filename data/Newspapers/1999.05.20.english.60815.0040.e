i have no idea how the British , French , Germans and Canadian curse when they have to deal with a blockhead who understands nothing of what is going around him . 
i assume their oaths aren't as vivid as ours , nor are their curses as picturesque as those improvised by Tudor Arghezi in his poems . 
i guess they just say " lousy communists " and off they go and never come back . 
over the last ten years , hundreds or maybe thousands of investors have been tendering for setting up or refitting water stations , car parks , , hotels , big shopping centres , hospitals or funfairs in Bucharest . 
and nothing has come of them , because the investors fell in to the hands of the starving Romanian bureaucracy that would pinch , drag out things and cause opportunities to end in smoke . 
i have knowledge of such cases . 
one of them is related to Canadian Peter Munck who in Toronto spoke about planning to invest 400 million dollars in an industrial park in Bucharest . 
Peter Munck ( one of the world 's tycoons and owner of the famous Sears - the world 's highest building - and of the television tower in Toronto ) , who felt drawn to Romania , tried to do business here too . 
the government and the capital city council made him change his mind . 
i also know the story of the most modern hospital in Eastern Europe , also planned to be built in Bucharest . 
the French got annoyed with the Romanians ' lust for money and the bureaucratic muddle , as it takes months here to get a formal approval . 
Inten years , Bucharest has made insignificant headway . 
some buildings have been whitewashed , and some new ones have been chaotically built , but we haven't been able to develop any worthy of note project . 
the city hall saw three disasters , with Crin Halaicu , who now lives on his own fat , holding the office of mayor for four years , followed by the vacillating Victor Ciorbea and the interim mayor Viorel Lis . 
after ten years , Bucharest prepares for a fresh political phut . 
an Urban Rehabilitation Agency and an Urban Development Agency . 
after ten years , we are going to have some fresh bodies to conceal to us the fact that we had incompetent mayors . 
the city is a mess with pitted roads and chaotically built constructions , heritage buidings fail to be repaired , the city council fail to impose rules on the building owners , commercial premises are handled based on political affinity or bribe , but selling them is an extremely difficult operation . 
the Romanian president goes to the city hall today to attend a city council meeting . 
maybe he ' ll manage to make Viorel Lis put aside his personal emotional tragedies and give up on idling his time at swimming pools in order to come back to reality . 
because Lis , a gentleman with the air of a nice person and a member of the Christian Democratic Party , is a man with a half - communist mentality . 
instead of setting to work the way a determined manager would do , instead of trying to do a way with all the absurd things going on in the capital city , the mayor laments like a helpless person or graciously beats about the bush in an abstruse language . 
" the main activity of the Agency Bucharest 2000 will be the management of activities of urban development and investments , as well as activities of consultancy in real estate businesses " , says the mayor set to talk claptrap . 
but in this case , what will he do ? 
play in movies ? 
and what about the graybeards at the city hall , what will they do ? 
and what 's the use of the institution we voted for ? 
they didn't manage to do as little as launching a campaign to save the city from the terror of the stray dogs , so much the least are they able to launch some serious projects to solve the city problems such as those related to the sewerage system , the water supply , the city 's historic centre , the public transport and the streets cleaning . 
after ten years , Romania 's capital city perfectly mirrors the weaknesses of our society . 
but moving the whole country is one thing , and being a city manager set to do some work is a totally different thing . 
and I don't mean small - scale projects , I mean long - lasting projects . 
the mayor and his party will probably say they lack this or that , that there is no legislation to regulate these matters , that they need a lever to put the planet in motion so we can see things changing here . 
Emil Constantinescu 's meeting with Viorel Lis could sound the reveille . 
why is it impossible to do the things that need to be done as long as so many things were done in only three days ahead of the Pope 's visit ? 
what are the city councillors and the city hall leadership wasting their time on ? 
what was the use of this legislature if all we did was moving things at snail pace ? 
the Christian Democrats and the Convention are on a fast track to lose their hold on Bucharest . 
this is the last possible moment when president Emil Constantinescu can try to sound the reveille . 
but a little devil under the table giggles and whispers they will never rouse .
