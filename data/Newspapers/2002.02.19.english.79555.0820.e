things will stay hazy till the documents of the Witch Congress get published . 
yesterday we didn't know yet if the spells cast by witches from several countries on the side of a secret puddle were successful or not . 
they did things and mumbled for the peace of the country . 
if spells worked , the government can sleep in peace . 
miners and steel workers won't rise this spring . 
if witches messed the water or cut it with a dull knife or sacrificed an one - eyed pigeon , we 're in trouble . 
we are in for hard times , people will take their protests to the streets , and the wings of the ruling party will start squabbling . 
the 80 witches gathered at the palace built in black marble in Bucurestii Noi neighbourhood in the capital city are our only hope . 
they claim Romania is going through a tough period , but stands chances of doing better towards the end of 2003 ( just as the governing programme says ) . 
you can realize what situation we are in if even the white magic ladies thought of resorting to spells so that politicians " rule the country well " . 
it stands to reason that politicians mismanaged the country and that they couldn't get to smooth water without the help of witchery . 
as for the economy , witches made gloomy predictions . 
the national currency will see a dangerous drop ( maybe the central bank 's governor Mugur Isarescu attended the witch meeting on financial issues ) . 
the dollar will keep its upward trend against the euro ( they haven't heard about the yen or the Swiss franc ) , and politicians are under the power of black magic . 
what does that mean ? 
that they have the Devil in them and that only after complicated and dangerous rituals will the spirit of evil be chased out of their souls . 
This is no laughing matter . 
it 's worth crying over it . 
but if the spell for the country 's peace works and trade unions turn in to singer bands , I for one am ready to change and never a gain make fun of witchcraft and foretelling . 
i pledge to get a white pigeon , a black cat with a split - in - two tail and a mouse with a green strip on his back and rush to Maria Cimpina who chaired the congress and tell her mighty queen , take the blood of these three innocent animals and pour it over a blue fire to see how much money did Nicolae Vacaroiu get from Sorin Ovidiu Vintu . 
and what other names of politicians can be read in the live coals . 
and how many times did Radu Timofte meet with Sorin Ovidiu Vintu . 
and who else did Teodor Nicolaescu give money to . 
i ' ll give them ten more pigeons and four cats if they can make all of them have shorter hands , even if we may find ourselves living in a country of cripple people . 
and if all these work , I for one will be ready to advocate that witches should rule the country . 
and even more . 
we could use them in the justice system , in courts or at the Prosecutor 's Office , and it wouldn't seem to me foolish to see them in the police as well . 
i would also use them to carry out the privatisation process . 
i would pin all my hopes on some sorcery work to get us in to NATO and the European Union and I would create the office of public witch under every rural or city hall . 
only then will we be a country of miracles , and with a couple of pigeons , an old hen , two cats shedding hair and three toothless snakes will we work out all our problems from the global ones to the garbage undergoing fermentation at street corners or dumped in rivers . 
obviously , it would be pointless to spend money from the state budget to keep the parliament or the presidency working . 
and we won't need TAROM airline any more . 
we would all ride on broomsticks .
