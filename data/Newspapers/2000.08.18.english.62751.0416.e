what happens today at the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) congress could be decisive for the evolution of the Romanian political scene . 
the party 's number two justice minister Valeriu Stoica in his attempt to break the old Liberal patterns will face his colleagues inclined to stick to the current political perimeter . 
Theodor Stolojan 's appointment as presidential candidate would mark the end of a family . 
the Liberals would no longer be so deep anchored in the rightist zone of the political spectrum . 
the Stoica - Stolojan victory would turn the PNL in to a more flexible partner . 
they could even enter an alliance with the main opposition party PDSR to have a president and a government . 
that is , a fresh sort of judgment and a different kind of politics . 
obviously , this would be no new development . 
they would only go back to the flexibility the PNL saw in Radu Cimpeanu 's days when for a short period the party found itself in the same boat with the National Salvation Front . 
and it lost . 
to sustain this trend a whole arsenal has been thrown in the battle : the opinion surveys conducted by CURS polling center , negotiations , instructions given to the heads of county party locals . 
all we can do is wait for the result which at this moment is far from being clear . 
why is that so ? 
because in the PNL there still is a pretty high number of Liberal hard liners . 
they will not sing to whatever tune just to get in power . 
they don't want Theodor Stolojan either . 
or an alliance with the PDSR . 
this wing relies on the party seniors , on Emil Constantinescu and a large part of the civic society . 
they ' d rather see Mugur Isarescu running for presidency . 
the spearheads of this trend are finance minister Traian Decebal Remes and Nicolae Manolescu who broke up with the Liberals to re - join the civic society . 
it was not accidentally that two days ahead of the PNL 's Extraordinary Congress prime minister Mugur Isarescu announced he would accept to run for president provided all the necessary signatures to support him are gathered . 
the prime minister 's letter was a discreet sign for his Liberal supporters that they had whom to fight for . 
moreover , his letter can also be seen as a sing that the " Theodor Stolojan offer " is not satisfying for an important number of parties or interest groups , for a part of the civic society and other forces that see Theodor Stolojan as an exponent of the past , a monochord politician for whom the prerogatives of the presidential institution boil down to economic concerns alone . 
moreover , the mysterious link between Theodor Stolojan and the strange Social - Liberal Initiative is regarded with maximum suspicion by all those who want to retain a certain " purity " of the party . 
the today congress is going to end bad for one of the parties . 
it 's outcome could tarnish Valeriu Stoica and Theodor Stolojan . 
but at the same time it could put Decebal Traian Remes in difficulty . 
a defeat suffered by the finance minister could result in two presidential candidates coming from the same side of the political scene . 
with Mugur Isarescu and Theodor Stolojan running on the same corridor we could be in for some further surprises . 
democrat Petre Roman and the Greater Romania Party head Corneliu Vadim Tudor could see their chances of making it to the runoff increase considerably . 
in the case of Ion Iliescu 's withdrawal , the final could see the long spoken about tandem fighting for victory . 
on the one hand Mugur Isarescu supported by the Right , on the other hand Theodor Stolojan supported by the Left plus a rebel rightist wing . 
what can we infer from all this ? 
that the ambitions involved in this game are extremely high and the risk could be fatal . 
but especially that the Romanian Right is a historical concoction . 
it doesn't really exist . 
there are only groups that come from the same grey world of victorious socialism who can endlessly put make up over make up in accordance with the times and their interests . 
it 's a blurred political zone in search of its identity , principles , reputation , norms , people , everything . 
the turbulence in this area of the political spectrum matches in intensity , proportion and political and doctrinal problems the mess existing at the opposite side of the political spectrum . 
what is going to be decided today at the PNL Extraordinary Congress isn't decisive only for Theodor Stolojan , but also for the party . 
i dare say that to the same extent the Liberals ' meeting today is also decisive for the evolution of the Romanian political scene , for the cast of the main characters to play in this fall 's elections . 
head or tail ?
