many people imagined Europe would be free from a fascist danger . 
who would have the courage to attempt to come forward with such a discourse ? ! 
much less to win democratically held elections on such a platform ! 
what happened in Austria where Joerg Haider ascended the power with his Freedom Party flabbergasted all old - world long - established democracies . 
the event caught all European governments unawares with not even a response strategy in hand . 
how should the phenomenon be dealt with ? 
by political and economic isolation ? 
world - wide boycott ? 
how could you react when you lack the instruments to do so since all European Union decisions call for unanimous voting , that is they call for Austria 's agreement too through the governing coalition including the Freedom Party , the very party that should have been isolated ? 
what topped it all was the fact that in their turn the first reactions against the state of affairs in Austria drew criticism . 
in Romania too quite a lot of people passed criticism on the European Union . 
why is the Union interfering with a country 's democratic options ? 
we 're facing a serious case of a nation 's independence violation ! 
some people in Bucharest even labelled the European states ' reaction as fundamentalistic and non - democratic . 
but all these reactions boil down to one word : confusion . 
the word could also be applied to describe the European Community reaction . 
the EU threatened to suspend Austria from the Union , or to put the country under strict monitoring or to stop bilateral contacts . 
various ways were used to put pressure on Austria due to the returns of polls held in line with all the game 's rules . 
what seems essential to me is the fact that despite incoherence triggered by hastily designed measures nobody even thought of supporting Joerg Haider . 
not even nationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor in Bucharest . 
the second most important thing is that in less than a month Haider was forced to tender his resignation . 
nevertheless , though it has softened its stand a little bit , the European Community is not satisfied . 
Austria ' sproblems will persist in the near future . 
the situation occurred following the polls in Austria mirrors major changes in the European politics . 
should a democratically installed ruling power be respected even if it goes against the human rights ? 
what will the European Union states do if an extremist party scores a landslide win in free elections ? 
will the EU obey the results of the polls or will they oppose them ? 
by what means ? 
can the European states ' military or even NATO step in to protect a minority if the latter was exposed to danger by the majority ? 
the answer would have been much easier had such a situation occurred outside the Union . 
but the ascension of the extreme right in Austria got things a little bit complicated and triggered confusion . 
the Haider case can be seen as a theory partly materialized and fit for being analysed . 
it has generated not only a political problem , but also a pure philosophical one , and it has the merit of underlining the frailty of democracy as a system . 
the Haider case is bound to trigger important modifications , the strategy of the European Union included . 
from now on , the democratic countries will have to find equally democratic solutions in case extremist forces get to power through free elections . 
how could the Union remain unstained if it was willing to cohabit with an extremist member state ? 
the intervention in Kosovo ( NATO against an elected power who oppressed a minority , without launching attacks on another state ) and Haider case are two precedents paving the way to a change of views . 
the international community will have the power to isolate , block or even intervene in situations when the results of a democratic process go fully against the values of civilized world and the human rights . 
the conclusion stands to reason . 
not all can be considered democracy that comes out of the ballot box . 
Europe saw Hitler because the great powers lacked the instruments to block fascism . 
it was reckoned humanity had learned enough from that lesson and mankind failed to prepare to handle a similar situation . 
Kosovo and Joerg Haider will bring about a change of angle in international politics and law . 
we are only a short while off from seeing the conclusions . 
and it is almost sure that the European Union states will lay down the procedures to be followed in similar cases . 
casting one 's vote becomes a matter of responsibility in third millennium Europe . 
because not all voting options will insure the observance of democracy . 
and not all polls will result in a power that is to be automatically validated by the European partners . 
a fresh democratic filter is to be implemented by the European Union .
