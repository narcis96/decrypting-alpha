things happening in the world these days also hide a trap for Romanian politicians . 
they may be tempted to believe people have something to think , talks and worry about and that they aren't paying too much attention to the rulers ' deeds . 
furthermore , they may also think they got lucky and got a way with it . 
Romanian 's attention is focused on events outside the country , and the state institutions can work undisturbed . 
what does " work " mean ? 
if some tend to believe this means arrangements , corruption , schemes , personal interests , then they are dreadfully wrong . 
winter is coming in Afghanistan , and the viewers will decry both the Talibans and Anglo - Americans . 
but when cold weather will hit Romania , people will focus on their daily hardships . 
an equally big mistake would be for us to consider ourselves lucky . 
that is to see the war against terrorism as something that will bring Romania unconditional advantages . 
more plainly put , if NATO fights against Bin Laden and the Talibans , Romania will surely be invited in at the summit in Prague . 
to think like that means to lose a train of the history . 
the coherent attitude of the authorities in Bucharest , beginning with September 11 , was perceived in a positive manner . 
we could say we got the highest mark at both artistic and political subjects . 
but the war against terrorism is far from being over and we still have time to spoil everything like we did it in the past , just before making it through . 
furthermore , even without the blunders typical of Romanian politics , we still have our shortcomings . 
it 's about corruption , privatisation , protection of underage minors and the independence of the justice system . 
regardless of when the war against terrorism will end , the four chapters are to be seriously assessed when Romania will be taken under debate . 
and they might account for much more than our politicians may believe today . 
do we have the time to solve all these in about a year ? 
absolutely not ! 
how can we do a way with a centuries - long corruption ? 
how can we solve the unfortunate situation of the street children and normalise international adoptions when there are so many stages to go through and , furthermore , so many interests at stake ? 
how can we sell so many companies and former state farms overnight when not even dumb clients are willing to buy them any more ? 
these chapters are surely hard to solve in one year 's time . 
we don't know whether in a decade 's time we will be able to mobilise ourselves for a dramatic change . 
as of next year , in Prague , or even before the summit , Romania must prove it has the will to approach these chapters from a different position . 
and to prove it has made real progress and that it is determined to carry out what it has begun . 
or , in order to achieve this , the rulers should change gear starting now . 
they shouldn't think they got lucky and no one will check their performance any more . 
Romanians ' attention is now focused on Afghanistan . 
but the rulers still have to face assessment of both the people and NATO .
