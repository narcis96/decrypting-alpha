a Turkey if I were , I still couldn't understand a thing of all these sensational disclosures made by Ovidiu Grecea . 
i keep asking for details left and right , but all I can get from my colleagues is a shrug or speculative suppositions . 
how on earth can the head of the government 's watchdog and corruption fighting body accuse ministers and officers , politicians and other public figures of being a mafia group sharing economic interests ? ! 
it 's funny to blame former education minister Andrei Marga for some privatisation contracts , as the Cluj native philosopher can't make head or tail of such things . 
but accusing members of the cabinet you are part of of dirty deals and see the prime minister reacting as if it was about a childish prank seems very strange to me . 
what should we gather from all this ? 
that Ovidiu Grecea should have told Adrian Nastase Sir , this is a serious matter ! 
i ' m being watched , my phone is bugged , we have in the government men you think they are trustworthy , but in fact they are part of a Cluj - based mafia group ! 
and the prime minister should have made a decision . 
but things didn't happen that way . 
the man who 's part of the Adrian Nastase cabinet didn't warn his boss , but instead dropped to the press a bomb that smears all over the government he is part of ( with a good pay and higher responsibilities ) . 
could it be that there are some interest groups in the PDSR ? 
could it be that there is a split up trend in the government ? 
and assuming some ministers are in deep trouble , why aren't these issues discussed in a cabinet meeting and why does Grecea come to the front in the spy - agent - 007 style ? 
this is what I can't understand ! 
is it possible that he stirred all this fuss only in retaliation for the fresh prerogatives ( a little bit exaggerated ) of the UM 0962 ( formerly UM 0215 - the intel gathering unit under the Interior Ministry ) ? 
it 's possible , but the way to do it is strange and beyond the logic of Romanian - style scenarios . 
in order to make something of Grecea 's coming on the stage , we turned to our computers and browsed the data base of our newspaper . 
Grecea said he would put the interior minister under investigation , if the case may be , ( sometime in 1998 ) - never done ! 
he started check ups in to Ioan Muresan 's affairs . 
case sent before the justice - never done ! 
in 1999 he announced he had spotted lots of irregularities in shady selloffs in Timis county . 
and he said he would make them public and then prosecutors and police would start investigations in to them - never done ! 
he said he was the " chief cleaning up man of the banking system in Romania " ( April 1999 ) - never been ! 
the announced thorough checks in to the activity of Electronica , European Drinks , Comcereal Timis companies - never done either ! 
they ended up in smoke like all the rest . 
he announced a check up in to the central bank 's activity would be run , quite a long while ago ( May 1999 ) - just another scarecrow ! 
Grecea also announced he would officially make Paunescu and Catarama pay off their debts to the state - never done ! 
it was the same Grecea who found out about the frauds at Bucharest Hotel . 
so what ? ! 
and what about the illegalities in connection with the special villas in Brasov and Predeal , have they ever been put under police and Prosecutor 's Office investigations ? 
and what has come out of it ? 
at a certain time ( in October 1999 ) Ovidiu Grecea himself said that Radu Vasile and Ion Diaconescu had asked him to do some cleaning up inside the Christian Democratic Party - never done ! 
it shouldn't be forgotten that Ovidiu Grecea worked under Doru Ioan Taracila , and Radu Vasile , and Traian Basescu , and Adrian Nastase . 
a thing becomes clear to me . 
Grecea may or may not be involved in some arrangements , but he surely talks a lot ! 
he starts playing an actor part rather than a political role . 
he starts enjoying this statement - making toy and this ferocious investigator self - image . 
and sometimes he plays his part in a more than childish manner ! 
going back to the accusations against some of the Adrian Nastase cabinet members , Ovidiu Grecea has stirred the first big storm I ' m not sure is what we absolutely need right now .
