it 's not the first time when in this front page corner I approach the subject of the East European women 's condition . 
their standing is much worse than the standing enjoyed by women who are lucky to live in the West , or in the USA , or in Canada . 
in Romania , women 's state of existence is simply awful . 
it 's a little easier only for women living in Bucharest , because here one stands higher chances to find a job or a place to take shelter from a crazy husband . 
but things are really bad for women living in small provincial towns . 
one can find no job in these places where factories are being closed down one after another . 
Saleswomen will hardly make four or five hundred lei a month . 
women with husbands out of job and in the habit of drinking can really consider themselves damned . 
they have no place to hide a way . 
they will grit their teeth and give up on any pleasure of live . 
what 's important to them is to have some clothing items to put on , manage to survive and be lucky enough not be beaten to death by their male partners ; to manage to stay in one piece and dream things will change for the better someday . 
but the male will get the April month issue of " Playboy " magazine and read about how he can beat his wife without covering her in bruises . 
he will get another beer , and try to check whether the article says the truth and the journalist did thorough research before writing it . 
and he 's right , because the article could be just a fabrication , couldn't it ? ! 
we quote : " The best thing is to focus on her hair . 
then go grab her hair . 
required utensils : a truncheon . 
use a makeshift , in case you lack a baton ! 
suggestions : a stirring stick , the driving belt of your washing machine . 
the job is as good as done if you firmly grab her by her hair , because there 's no way she can break free from your hold . 
but the operation is not over . 
take a chopping board and place it in the area of your wife 's liver . 
all you have to do then is hit the board with the truncheon . 
hit it hard and let off your proletarian wild rage . 
and what it more important - show no fear ! 
you ' d better give up on the whole matter if you are afraid . 
hit it hard , because you don't know when you ' ll get a second chance to do that ! 
and don't get scared , even if she cries in pain ! 
that 's just a trick ! 
the important thing is the way you hold your victim . 
at first , your lack of experience will help the woman escape your grip . 
when this happens , you should administer her a supplementary final treatment , just to get her used to it ! 
after finishing the job , just lie back and enjoy the view . 
she ' ll start swearing at you , threaten you with divorce , court proceedings , alimony and other rubbish of the sort . 
" the huge mistake made by the " Playboy " editors is that they imagined Romanians don't know how to beat their wives . 
but they are PhD 's in this matter ! 
and they give a damn on whether they will cover their wives in bruises or not . 
only special treatments administered by former political police Securitate used to show this kind of " skill " . 
Romanian men will simply beat their wives without any concern about the effects . 
domestic violence can result in trauma , mutilation , even death , but these effects seem to move nobody any longer . 
press will report everyday on domestic violence incidents with tragic consequences . 
which is why the magazine 's infelicitous concerns are really stupid . 
what 's the use of describing the technique of beating your wife without bruising her as long as men know they have nothing to fear of even if they beat their wives black and blue ? 
police won't step in , so much the less the justice , relatives will only show compassion ( or even contribute some punches ) . 
which is why the concern about not leaving traces of domestic violence is an indulgence to poor people . 
i though a magazine like " Playboy " would share a bit of the American experience with the Romanian readers . 
in the USA , you can kiss your freedom goodbye if you dare lay a finger on your wife or kids . 
you ' ll end up in the right place , namely in jail . 
The article in the April issue of " Playboy " magazine has stirred feelings of righteous indignation in some ladies . 
and they are right to feel this way , because it is a crime to " counsel " men on how to beat their wives without bruising them in a country with a high rate of domestic violence cases . 
the article was aimed to be a funny prank , a journalistic gimmick . 
but it 's a joke told at a time when everybody is in agonies . 
in fact , the " brilliant " joke published by the " Playboy " magazine could occur only on the background of widely spread indifference towards domestic violence women fall victims to . 
nobody 's trying to change people 's mentality . 
nobody 's got time for such things . 
moreover , approaching such a subject can even be considered an out of line move . 
what 's wrong with you , man , do you really think this is what we ' ve got on our mind now ? 
We want to be Westerners when it comes to wages , free travelling , city cleanness and the quality of services . 
but we want to stick to our old conduct or even worse when it comes to being absent without leave from work , to law observance , to domestic violence , to our disregard for animals and nature . 
we want to wear expensive French perfumes and beat our wives with the porridge stirring stick .
