it 's not at all easy for a prime minister of an Eastern Europe country to go on a visit to the USA . 
especially at a time like this when Washington has to deal with two major problems : Afghanistan and anthrax . 
everything else is hardly noticed in comparison to the economic consequences of these problems . 
probably that 's the explanation for a certain degree of discretion surrounding the Romanian premier 's visit to the American capital city . 
at the same time , besides the bad luck of being there at a time like this , prime minister Adrian Nastase seems to have rushed to go on this visit . 
the pride of being among the first ten heads of states and governments to go to the USA after the terrorist attack on September 11 , as well as the favourable impact of the decisions recently made by Romania 's Parliament made him not to postpone his journey . 
and his move is somehow understandable . 
any politician nurturing high aspirations , after seeing himself comfortably in office at home , starts dreaming about getting political recognition overseas . 
at the same time , Adrian Nastase also thought the visit would give him the opportunity to make the most of the popularity he enjoys at home . 
sort of political gossip started to circulate even abroad . 
it speaks about the coherent attitude of the fresh ruling team in Bucharest and the way they act . 
the saying " he looks good and knows how to behave " holds good everywhere in the world . 
but despite all this , the prime minister didn't make a major impact on the first days of his visit . 
he didn't make a bad impression ( in my opinion ) , but he didn't manage to stir high waves either . 
the Foreign Minister , the Romanian Embassy in Washington and the premier 's team had prepared a complex programme . 
Adrian Nastase knocked on the doors of all major American institutions and tried to be credible . 
but he hasn't got any " cheques " that could make one jump for joy . 
he had talks with officials at the Department of State , the White House , the International Monetary Fund , the Attorney General 's Office etc. 
but with all those meetings , ( till the time I ' m writing these lines ) none of the people he had had talks with accompanied the Romanian prime minister to any press conference to make a firm joint declaration . 
the head of the Romanian executive went to the press conference alone briefly speaking about the talks he had had and saying they had been extremely interesting . 
this detail can say lots of things . 
it can say , among other things , that the American top political figures have other priorities at present and won't waste precious minutes to say how fond they are of Romania in a moment when they are tremendously worried about something else . 
what great thing can you accomplish when on the first day of your visit Attorney General John Ashcroft announces other terrorist attacks against America could occur on the following days ? 
at the same time , we must think whether it could be that Adrian Nastase was included in the " we have to think it over " chapter . 
the truth is that after ten months in office all the prime minister could show the Americans was his good image , but he couldn't show them four - five hard nuts of the Romanian transition and say " we ' ve managed to crack them " . 
he couldn't crack them at home , so he couldn't be offered them in a cake in Washington . 
the stand - by agreement signed with the IMF and the way he pleaded for Romania 's integration with NATO are successful moves , but not victories . 
the domestic economic situation stands just like a pointer between the delegation members ' wish to believe that each meeting was a great success and the skepticism of those who say that nothing can be done . 
the economic situation alone can confirm either the hopes expressed in the USA or our already classic doubts . 
p . S . Surprise development . 
president George Bush invited Adrian Nastase for talks at the White House .
