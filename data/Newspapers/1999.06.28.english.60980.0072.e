there are few cases as indicative of the miserable character of Romanian politics as SUN OIL and the Bod - based sugar refinery affairs . 
this doesn't mean other counties haven't seen similar situations with the participation of top representatives of current coalition parties and even of the former coalition . 
the only difference is that these last two dirty affairs were so rudely carried out that they clearly showed the way political influence was used when sharing out the former socialist economy . 
the latest scandals make clear that public debates , ideas confrontations , and reform strategies are but a cheap , just for - the - show theatre that hides the terrible fight for grabbing bigger , cheaper or even free of charge stakes in this economy . 
the fight against corruption was launched to penalize these attempts , at least the large - scale ones , in order to temper the greediest or the insatiable . 
but the anti - corruption fight got entrapped in the state institutions , the political mesh and even in its exaggerated dirigisme . 
anti - corruption fight also came to a deadlock because it was too often used as an instrument to put pressure on opponents , and because it has never been blind as it should be , just like justice . 
i say this because most often the anti - corruption fight targeted people from the opposite camp . 
but let 's go back to SUN OIl and sugar refinery cases . 
it 's about two big financial " blows " typical of the transition period and struck by some anonymous people with some political figures of the Democratic Party ( PD ) discreetly swarming around them . 
Petre Roman 's party was taken by surprise when the scandals broke . 
The party  unconvincingly denied everything . 
democrat deputy Corneliu Ruse linked by the local press to those arrested in the SUN OIl affair in Ploiesti renounced his top offices , and prefect Ioan Opris arrested over involvement in Bod sugar refinery case was dismissed from his office at the Democratic Party request and replaced with another PD top figure . 
to put it in plain words , the party made two moves that showed it was ashamed of what had happened , which is something that rarely happens in politics and doesn't last long . 
the Democratic Party changed the tune shortly after , either because they thought some other similar affairs might surface that could cause some heads to fall , or because they yielded to some pressure from the party 's ranks , saying " you just let them execute us without the slightest opposition ? 
" the risk that some other similar cases be exposed was huge and it could have had a devastating impact on the party . 
and after having been knocked out , the Democratic Party recovered and launched the counteroffensive . 
neither Democrat transport minister Traian Basescu , nor PD deputy Paula Ivanescu uttered a word about the " heroic " deeds of the two top party figures mentioned above , as if they were some nation heroes or poor victims . 
financial frauds in Ploiesti and Brasov caused tens of billions in damages to the state , so what ? 
PD men appointed or elected to benefit Romania played a part in these affairs , so what ? 
and even if they had played no part in these affairs , the party should have severely penalized them , or even oust them from the party , for failing to notice the absurd things going on around them . 
only that such things happen in a normal world , where morals and common sense rule . 
but as here things go just the other way round , instead of seeing the Democratic Party shaking from its foundations , we were served hysterical political statements such as " base attacks " , " political order " and " dirty political affair " . 
the nervous and violent reaction was a clear way to say " we withdraw from the government " . 
it does no longer matter whether the PD men are guilty or not , whether they did their job or turned a blind eye to lawbreaking deeds . 
the only thing that matters is that the party be not damaged . 
and if someone dares to crease the party 's haute couture suit , then they say it 's enough , they threaten to walk out of the government and push the country to the edge of early elections . 
but the idea of early elections is appealing neither to the Christian Democrats , nor to the Liberals or the ethnic Hungarians alliance . 
and therefore , Ioan Opris was released from police custody overnight , investigations in to the frauds will go on until we get bored and completely forget about them , and Petre Roman displayed a manly behaviour before a bomb - scared party . 
moreover , the Democrats threatened to disclose some things . 
what things ? 
and why don't they do it ? 
as long as nobody interferes with their interests , they can enjoy their slice of the pie . 
if you start inquiring in to their affairs , they get upset and label the move as political revenge . 
by adopting such a strategy , Petre Roman and his party managed to see their ratings further shrinking . 
had it distanced itself from the two , the party would have shown us it had nothing to hide , and that unlike its coalition partners , it was merciless even when the slightest shadow of doubt was hanging over one of its members . 
by launching the counteroffensive , the Democratic Party only showed its firm determination to protect its members , in a move perceived by the electors as a way to bury some dirty affairs . 
the SUN OIL and sugar refinery affairs were the most serious dent in the Democratic Party 's image since in government . 
and this happens right at the moment when the Romanian electors are looking for a serious party , able to raise above the miserable standard of Romanian politics .
