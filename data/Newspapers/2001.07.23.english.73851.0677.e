only God knows how many Romanians fell in love in Costinesti , and how many launched out in to showbiz there . 
for all these , the little village at the Black Sea is like an island surrounded by light . 
in the year 2001 , Costinesti is shocking , an endless kiosk trading dominated by poverty and bad taste . 
stalls , filthy pubs , sun terraces full of plastic , Oriental music , and stickers , smell of pies mixed with that of fermented rubbish , a degrading atmosphere in which swarm drunken young people and teenagers preoccupied about how to live on a ten thousand lei note from morning to night . 
everything is slapdash , without any rhyme or reason . 
from festivals , shows and debates to concerts and international meetings , everything has fallen in to the cheap fair you can also find in the other Black Sea resorts of Venus , Jupiter and even on the main street in Neptun . 
in Costinesti , Vox Maris and Forum are trying hard to keep their distance from the merciless attack of kiosk trading , a constant which can be found from Venus up to the entrance to Mamaia . 
Mangalia and Mamaia are the only places which give visible signs of changing . 
everything else is a disaster . 
don't go to the seaside with too high hopes . 
don't eat anywhere , don't buy anything . 
traps and filth are at every step of the way while the revival of the Romanian tourism is still very far a way . 
all the efforts made by the Tourism Minister , all the projects and " threats " can't still be seen in the appearance of the Romanian seaside . 
the privatization process is only relaunching these days , but not even Mafalda can predict how long it will take , how it will be carried out and who will get the best of it . 
the famous " Europe " project is only a sentence said by the Tourism Minister in front of the tv cameras . 
a few years will pas until something is done about this . 
the observance of the laws , no matter how much the checks by the authorities have intensified , remains an aspiration always prevented by poverty , bad taste and corruption . 
what can you do to the poor man if he has money only to buy plastic slippers , doughnuts , a cheap bottle of mineral water and a bed in a hot hotel room , with no warm water , phone or tv set . 
the seaside is full of people and is hot . 
it 's like a plucked parrot tossing about in dust and heat . 
it 's expensive , strident , and full of farces . 
we don't recommend you to spend your holiday somewhere else , but also don't recommend you to raise your hopes too high . 
a part from a good point scored by Mamaia and a few other discreet places , which a few more intelligent investors have managed to arrange , this year the seaside resembles perfectly the seaside last year and the rest of Romania , still suffocated by kiosk trading .
