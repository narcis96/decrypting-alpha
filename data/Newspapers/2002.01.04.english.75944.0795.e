we may have been following the wrong path for many years now deluding ourselves we ' ve been doing the right thing , just to find we have been heading to nowhere , after a thorough exam . 
we have got free elections based on political competition . 
but this is only a premise for democracy . 
if we assessed the results , democracy would fade a way . 
after inserting the voting card in to the slot , the importance of the citizen diminishes dramatically . 
his power , declared supreme in the election campaign , shrinks like the countries put on the map by reduction on the 1:1,000 or 1:10,000 scale . 
the elect no longer respect him , nor does he fight to keep himself as part of the game . 
all that remains is a certain interest in keeping the appearances . 
does the citizen have the right to enter associations , protest , file complaints ? 
he does ! 
does he have the right to free access to information and expression ? 
he does ! 
formally . 
he actually has the right to freely express himself provided that he does not bother anybody . 
from that moment on he is no longer an average citizen . 
he becomes an enemy . 
doors are slapped in to his face or is even hunted down by the same institutions that owe him respect and regard . 
theoretically , the right to information is unlimited . 
practically , it resembles the right of choosing between a cat and a dog . 
it 's a sort of compulsory information based on what is provided to you and what is not . 
has anyone got the right to file complaints ? 
they have it ! 
so what ? ! 
how many of the situations denounced through complaints are solved without involving the fight with bureaucracy , inertia , petty bribery ? 
how many civil servants in Romania hurry to do their jobs after receiving a complaint from someone ? 
try to protest over the decision taken by a civil servant , a mayor , a minister or the government . 
the first thing you will learn is that you were wrong . 
the second , that you were not the person who should have filed a complaint . 
the third is that you have broken some law . 
the fourth , that is not the time . 
the fifth , some stupid explanation . 
the 100 or 1000 nd thing will certainly not be the confirmation of your being right . 
what do all these tell us ? 
that our democracy doesn't look bad on the surface . 
it is exportable . 
in its essence , it is not worth much . 
laws are useful only to those who draw them up , institutions - only to those running them . 
citizens may whistle for it . 
and the fundamental principle of democracy , according to which minority submits to the will of majority , risks being altered in its essence . 
after the elections , both majority and minority submit to a handful of people . 
they use the democratic principles just to protect themselves . 
and thus we reach the conclusion that democracy is good for some and a burden for others . 
in fact , what really hurts everybody , even if it sounds good in all appearances , has nothing to do with real democracy . 
how could we find Romanian democracy 's efficiency is on the up while Romanians ' living standard is constantly on the down ? 
it is a fundamental contradiction between the political and institutional facade and everyday reality . 
if we kept following the same path , we may have some day a democracy resembling that of England , France or the United States , while the living standard would be that of Somalia or Biafra . 
what would be then the use of a democracy perfect on the surface , but powerless at its essence and with no positive effects ? 
as long as Romanian democracy offers prosperity to a handful of people and ruins the others , it remains mostly a false democracy .
