why on earth do Romanians harbour such a feeling of dislike for monarchy ? 
the fright in connection with the king 's return has died out . 
politicians no more poison the air with fears aimed to hide their meanness and to turn people against an imaginary enemy . 
the great disputes now are over high offices , advantages and money . 
but our anti - monarchist spirit is still with us . 
why ? 
this question lingers in my mind after reading the last pages of the book " A royal sacrifice - Ferdinand of Romania " . 
and in order to try to give answers to some other people , I have first to try to find answers for myself . 
really , why am I not a monarchist ? 
the fact I can feel no bond with the concept is not enough . 
nobody in my family has ever spoken about the king . 
probably we were too far a way . 
nor has anybody brought us some book on one of our kings . 
in school we learned only a few things about them . 
they were mentioned only in some lines in our text books . 
for a long time I even couldn't tell who was who . 
the history legends in school started with Burebista and Decebal , dwelt on Stefan cel Mare and Mihai Viteazul and stopped at Alexandru Ioan Cuza . 
after Cuza , except for two sequences dedicated to the War of Independence and the Great Union in 1918 , we were directly introduced to the workers ' movement and the prefab stars to provide communists with some predecessors . 
but text books didn't speak of any kings . 
for fifty years most of the Romanians have been instructed and educated to despise monarchy . 
and this process could successfully be carried out against the background of Romanians ' fundamental lack of interest in monarchy . 
after all , a country that hasn't been able to have a dynasty in centuries couldn't be converted to monarchist views only because of some Hohenzollerns . 
in fact , the gap in the Romanian history is the monarchy itself , and its absence is a natural thing for Romanians . 
by our nature , we are incompatible with ceremonial rules , unmovable hierarchy , and symbols likely to show us how small we are . 
we like republic better , because it 's closer to the pleasure of gossip , of arguing , of mockery . 
this sort of republican - type democracy we understand wrongly and put in practice in a catastrophic way can blur our vision and prevent us from knowing in detail " the royal break " Romania went through since Charles I to King Michael I. 
it was almost a century that brought Romania her independence and allowed her to manifest herself as a unitary state , two crucial moves carried out under the rule of some kings who were neither Romanians , nor Orthodox Christians . 
i experienced a feeling of embarrassment when reading Martha Bibescu 's essay . 
i don't know how much we owe Charles I and Ferdinand and how much credit they deserve which we fail to give . 
even after 1990 , when publications got out of the party 's control , few books have been published on them and have gone almost unnoticed . 
a proletarian spirit with roots in bad taste still keeps us far a way from two exceptional figures of our history . 
Martha Bibescu 's text published in 1927 in French in Paris has the merit of opening to us a door to Ferdinand of Romania . 
what tops it all is that the work of this lady writer , perhaps the greatest lady writer Romania has ever had , isn't in a very happy situation either . 
it is as little known and loved as the king she wrote about . 
Martha Bibescu was a close acquaintance of Ferdinand and her observations focus more on the man than on the monarch . 
after eight decades , Romanians meet a sad , weakling and lonely German , tormented by his own condition of being a king nobody wanted in Romania , but who was never loved in Germany either . 
it 's the story of a Catholic believer more mysterious than a shadow , who baptized his children in compliance with the religion of the country he was not meant for . 
Ferdinand was a king regarded as a foreigner , but who tragically assumed the condition of a Romanian citizen the moment he declared war against his native country . 
only Martha Bibescu 's genius accounts for the fact that this text is not only a portrait few people have managed to make , but also the historical and philosophical interpretation of Ferdinand 's role . 
only a Romanian lady exiled to another culture environment could understand the destiny of a king sent to shepherd a nation he didn't belong to at the moment of his coronation . 
through Martha Bibescu 's book , the game of the fate made this introvert , discreet Hohenzollern with health problems since his youth come to our country and become a great Romanian figure . 
he gave a large part of his assets to the countryside people who fought in the first world war . 
he turned the Great Union in to his credo and paid with his own money the setting up of the Romanian language universities in Cluj and Cernauti . 
probably I ' m not a monarchist both because of the education I received and because of my natural tendency . 
and because of the instruction I received . 
and this holds good for many other people , maybe for most of them . 
but it would be terribly sad for us to be anti - monarchists because of politics and our lack of culture .
