i think there is hardly one Romanian left who failed to see through this cheap trick . 
a politician ' smaking a shocking statement then saying it isn't true is just a sign he was blabbering . 
the man lets off steam , but afterwards some more powerful men tell him : " What did you say , you fool , you got us in deep shit ! 
now you go and say that those stupid journalists didn't have good tape recorders on them and they misunderstood what you meant ! " 
this is what happened to premier Radu Vasile 's statement last week . 
the Joker premier could no longer stand the torpor inside the PNTCD Christian - Democratic party and told Reuters that the IMF is throwing spanners in our works and that himself is willing to fight for the Christian - Democrats in the next elections , but only as party president . 
god had hardly allowed us two days when Radu Vasile made a U - turn saying that Reuters in the interview released only presented excerpts which " do not render with the necessary accuracy the meaning of what the prime - minister stated " . 
this could make you choke with laughter ! 
it is as if the Reuters reporters were some unreliable characters . 
let 's admit that the reporter did not render " with accuracy " . 
this can happen . 
but then why didn't the premier say the following day that his words were misinterpreted ? 
why did he need a meeting with PNTCD leader Ion Diaconescu to say this ? 
if it had been a lie , Radu Vasile would have released a denial . 
he wouldn't have needed a joint communique with the PNTCD head . 
moreover , if we thoroughly analyze the text , the smart U - turn made by the larkish premier will show . 
the following were agreed upon in the communique released by the two : " Election of all office - holders within the party shall be held at the January 2000 Convention , except for the top leadership posts , namely president , prime - vice - president and secretary , with current holders of these posts to have their term in office extended by a year and the new top - level leadership of the party to be elected after parliamentary elections during an extraordinary Convention to be called in January 2001 " . 
so Radu Vasile , who was grumbling in order to get presidency of the party , can whistle for it and admits that for the time being he no longer wants the post . 
besides , the two announced that the top leadership won't be replaced during the 2000 Convention of the PNTCD . 
but is the party theirs so that they are entitled to decide by themselves : " we won't step down , man ! " 
what is the PNTCD , some cart ridden by two drivers who agree they won't let hold of the reins or is it a democratic party , that takes measures in compliance with statute provisions ? 
given the hints the premier made at taking over PNTCD leadership , we think that he clipped the long nail of his little finger and decided to become a reliable politician . 
he hasn't the power to run the executive , but he can prove he is an artist when it comes to manipulating politicians . 
he can prove that his typically Romanian gift for deceiving , duping , tricking is efficient in controlling a hornet 's nest . 
the embarrassing way in which he yielded to the seniors , that is to Ion Diaconescu in particular , only shows his option for the " always land on your feet " style , apparently charming but which in fact is distressing . 
joker cannot even wage war ! 
he will beat about the bush , dodge the issue and finally reach the starting point . 
by drawing back this time Radu Vasile only showed that high stakes are out of his league , that he only excels in chats and that he has a hard time when it comes to more than tittle - tattle over a beer . 
it is something else that I find important about this communique , namely that Ion Diaconescu all by himself managed to announce that the Christian - Democrats president will only be replaced by an extraordinary Convention to be called in 2001 , after the parliamentary elections . 
so it was he the one to come forward with the announcement yet a gain and it was he the one to set the line of his political party . 
maybe things were clarified inside some leading core like the BCCC , but nobody had made this public . 
or going public with such a decision after a bargaining between Ion Diaconescu and Radu Vasile looks like a move in breach of the statute , if not like a political disarray . 
moreover , the document shows that the Christian - Democrats won't change a thing at the top levels . 
the party is frozen until the elections , and it can only be revitalized if trounced at the polls .
