i sit down in front of my TV set to watch Romania 's match with England hoping against hope that we ' d manage to win . 
i knew the condition for my hope to come true was for us to have the devil 's own luck or for the English to have a historic run of ill luck . 
and after the first five minutes I thought we were an illogical nation , even in point of football . 
our incomplete team ( without its number one player Gica Hagi ) who had made a slapdash work of the matches with Germany and Portugal was looking and playing like an European or world champion . 
it 's been many , many years since Romania 's national team last played so beautifully . 
at full speed , showing great technical skill and displaying the attitude of a great team the way we ' d never had before . 
you simply felt like crossing yourself in bewilderment . 
and then came the disaster . 
from 1 - 0 score for Romania we came to be led by an English line - up of great stars , but who didn't show at all like a great team . 
at that moment everything seemed lost . 
our team had only the experience of nervous breakdown . 
usually they are not able to make a comeback after losing a fragile advantage . 
and a gain something happened we ' d never thought possible . 
with the English side in the lead , our team played as if unaware that a win was a must for us . 
Dorinel Munteanu 's kick sent the score 1 - 1 and then the Romanian team taught the English a lesson as they were all over them until the latter finally gave in . 
from an out of fashion old team , the Romanians turned in to a suffocating , choking storm , a stunning mixture of energy and lucidity which I ' m afraid we ' ll never be able to show a gain . 
without Hagi and Gica Popescu we showed what we didn't think we had : a bright team with Belodedici showing not his age , but his carats . 
if we manage to overcome Italy we ' ll be able to say we have overcome the change of generation problem without all the suffering and the anonymity other teams in the same situation ( Poland , Holland , Hungary and Germany ) are faced with . 
we can't approach this historic match without warning against a danger that comes from a complex of the old generation during the communist years when it seemed to us that as a communist country we were always marginalised in all sports competitions . 
this conspiracy complex was used as a justification for our poor living standard and for the fact that the victorious socialism was causing us nothing but troubles . 
hypocrisy turned official politics would hide our weakness . 
we would blame an outsider whenever we failed to do a thing . 
just like Cristian Topescu did the other night in his sports commentary . 
behind the times Cristian Topescu , fearing defeat , as well as his colleague Sorin Hobana repeatedly accused Swiss referee Urs Meier of showing hostile to Romania and implicitly of rendering services to the great football powers . 
had we lost to England on Tuesday night , a blind wave of antipathy towards the West would have seized our country . 
no Romanian would have admitted at least for a moment that the Swiss referee had made a mistake . 
the conspiracy complex would have created sort of a national belief that the Romanian team had been disadvantaged in order for room to be made for weaker , but richer teams . 
nobody would have admitted that Urs Meier had made a mere mistake or that his conscience was untroubled as he knew he had been acting in a fair , clean manner . 
the Swiss referee was lucky to be faced with almost similar situations where both teams were concerned . 
the decision to show Adrian Ilie a yellow card for faking a fault was also made in the case of the English team captain Alan Shearer . 
he granted the English team a penalty kick based on the same criteria he granted us one at a crucial moment when he could very well not do it . 
had things stood the way the state TV commentators on the spot were implying the Swiss referee wouldn't have signed the English team elimination from Euro 2000 three minutes before the end of the match . 
nor would he have showed Shearer a yellow card . 
it was a blessing that the Romanian team didn't yield to pressure following the goals scored by the English team and that God helped us to avert a disaster . 
because had the Romanian team been defeated , this unjustified feeling of hatred of the West would have been a consequence more serious than the bitter feeling of failure . 
and Cristian Topescu and Sorin Hobana , maybe out of misplaced patriotism or nationalism that assumes melodramatic tones even in sports commentaries , would have been fully responsible for this feeling . 
but as Romania won the match , we managed to avoid a fit of nation - wide anti - European hysteria . 
UEFA has no idea what catastrophic changes the Romanian politics could have undergone because of two or three mistakes made by a referee and misinterpreted by commentators with a profound conspiracy complex .
