i have repeatedly written about the Romanians who leave the country . 
i even said one time that every national looking for a job elsewhere on the planet is a slap in the political class ' face . 
this could be sort of a mathematical formula based on which the exact amount of responsibility of the country 's rulers may be calculated . 
back then we were blaming the PDSR for this , now we should do the same ( and we did do it ) where the new power is concerned . 
in theory , this is how things stand . 
but what actually happens is different . 
many Romanians leave the country , and the press is deploring the phenomenon , as it if were signalling the beginning of the end to Romania . 
there is something which makes me not to share this despair . 
firstly , massive economically - motivated emigration has occurred in other countries , too . 
Italians left their homeland in the 50 s and spread all a cross Europe . 
you could see them doing jobs everywhere , in restaurants , in constructions , at stores . 
the same goes for Greeks , too . 
during Greece 's bad times after the war , our friends were everywhere , except for Alaska and the Antarctic . 
not to mention the Lebanese who , in some South American countries , even have MPs . 
only the children , the elderly and those who set up profitable businesses stayed at home . 
and what happened to these countries and peoples ? 
did they die out ? 
did they weaken following massive emigration ? 
not in the least ! 
they grew stronger because emigrants never broke a way with their homeland . 
they found jobs everywhere and came back home to invest the money . 
the Lebanese are all over the world , but they have their villas built on the edge of the stone amphitheatre that the Lebanon is . 
their money is in Lebanese banks . 
and from this phenomenon which at first seems a nuisance a huge revenues source stems for the country in question . 
millions of Turks work in Western Europe ( they even have a TV channel in Germany ! ) and only blindfold Romanians cannot notice the long files of cars driven a cross Romania in July and August when they go on vacation to their native country . 
why should we be scared that Romanians are migrating ? 
what are they supposed to do at home ? 
work for a hundred dollar pay ? 
from whom could they learn how capitalism works ? 
are they supposed to wander the streets while on the dole , wearing a way their shoe soles looking for a job , and starting to steal when at a loss ? 
are they supposed to deal in some small pilferage , whispering " cengi " ( hard currency exchange ) at street corners ? 
how could they learn what democracy is from all sort of compatriots who , either making a show of themselves as being in power or doing nothing , say " what 's it to you , we live in a democracy so I do what I please ! " 
isn't it better for them to try and find their chance elsewhere ? 
finding a job abroad is not only financially - motivated , as those in question will not only get $ 10,000 - 20,000 a year . 
they will also learn something else , firstly attitude towards work . 
they will quickly learn what discipline is and will see that they have to break their back for every penny they earn . 
it is only in foreign countries that Romanians will learn how to respect the law , how to hold politicians accountable for what they do and for the money they spend . 
living in developed countries among their citizens , Romanians will see how important the civil society organization , the vote and civilized protest are . 
the return home of the Romanians who left abroad to work will mean to Romania not only money , but also an import of Western civilization . 
this outflow of nationals going to work in Western countries followed by their inflow back home will speed up Romania 's modernization process . 
the first concern which could occur is that Romania will be deserted , that the last one to leave will turn off the lights ( like in the joke dating back since uncle Nicu ) . 
this is a " patriotic " groundless fear . 
firstly , the children , the elderly and many of the women will not leave . 
secondly , those who got a job at solid private companies and those who started a business will not live to save their life . 
and if openings show up on the labour market , they will be promptly filled , particularly by foreigners , who are a big gain when it comes to changing mentalities and to the functioning of the institutions . 
so this would also benefit Romania 's progress . 
Romanians ' emigration should no longer be deplored . 
somebody should tell the brave ones : " leave , work , learn then come back home " . 
bilateral agreements with various countries should be signed to allow Romanian workforce to legally enter these labour markets . 
Romania 's gain from this would be tremendous . 
but before telling them to leave , they should know one thing . 
conditions for those willing to work abroad are incredibly tough . 
so if you 're not high - powered and rock - hard , stay at home and brace yourselves as more trouble is in store !
