not even the privatisation of the industrial chunks can match in difficulty the restructuring process of the military . 
when it comes to " the great accomplishments of the victorious socialism " you still can work out some solution . 
pass an emergency decree to write off the companies ' debts , sell them off for cheap money and so get rid of some of them . 
the new owners will either switch to another line of business or sell them by the tonne or square meter . 
workers may not work in a steel mill or some other plant any more , but they will still be workers . 
with a little effort they can train for some other job . 
and people laid off from some factory or plant can still find a job . 
in the construction sector , or highway building sector , anywhere . 
things are different with the military . 
they ' ve been educated and persuaded that their role is vital . 
that without them , the country is like an onion in the garden which anybody can steal . 
opinion polls too show us that the church and the military enjoy the highest credibility ratings among all state institutions , which is an indication that we are a nation dominated by two ideas - " with God " and " against the enemy " . 
in other countries , opinion polls show the military holds the sixth , or seventh , or tenth place in the top of credibility ratings . 
in some other countries , it doesn't even show in the polls . 
in Romania , the military is the essence of national security . 
if we were to find out that the military didn't exist any more , we wouldn't have the courage to go as far as the shop at the corner of our street . 
what if the enemy will show up ? 
against such a background , how can you lay off 4,000 officers in one single move ? 
will the officers , their families and the rest of the Romanian society understand that the modernization of the military calls for such drastic measures ? 
the answer is no ! 
this also shows in the low efficiency of the job conversion measures . 
out of 18,500 military staff laid off between 1998 and 2000 , only 50 have undergone job conversion training . 
the figure is meaningless if it were to be used as an argument to ease the pressure put by military staff to be dismissed . 
none of them are hopping with joy . 
they curse one party or another , the government and even NATO . 
the military restructuring is one of the transition 's toughest jobs . 
military parades are nice to watch , it 's heart - lifting seeing them presenting arms , and it 's reassuring to see them training with no enemy around . 
but the restructuring process is awfully painful , and there is no " anesthesia " available to ease the pain . 
the only possible solution implies a lot of money . 
and there isn't enough money either for the modernization of the military or for those who are going to be laid off . 
the Adrian Nastase government is facing now a test to the core . 
a test more difficult than the privatisation of Calan - based mine , or the steel mills in Hunedoara and Galati towns , or the tractor and truck makers in Brasov , or of any other state - owned loss - making industrial chunk . 
and Ioan Mircea Pascu is now facing his main exam in his capacity as defence minister . 
it 's not an easy exam for him to pass , all the more since the officers ' low morale is not their only problem . 
there are some other problems , such as the money for equipment , fuels , drills . 
where from can they get this money ? 
the military parades on national holidays are so nice and impressive ! 
and people who salute them in the name of the country are so proud ! 
they feel breathless with pride seeing such a force presenting arms ! 
but you wouldn't want to be a defence minister or to run a cross a general when you have to tell the military that as of tomorrow they are no longer officers , that they have to pack up their things and go home to waste their time a way or perhaps to try and get some fresh job !
