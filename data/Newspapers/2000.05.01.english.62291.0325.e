people sending each other greetings cards on special occasions is a long - established tradition . 
in the course of time , people started to send greetings cards accompanied by small " courtesy gifts " . Private businessmen send cards accompanied by a chocolate bar , a box of juice cans , a bottle of wine or champagne , or a pack of coffee . 
and sometimes promotional items . 
only God knows whether this is sort of a funny way to send greetings or not . 
it certainly isn't a blamable thing . 
but there 's a long way from sending " courtesy gifts " to the substantial Christmas or Easter presents given to public servants . 
unfortunately , our editorial desk hasn't got as many powerful lens cameras as needed to keep an eye on the homes of all dignitaries and high officials in state institutions . 
which is why instead of staging a watch operation , the " Evenimentul zilei " crew staged a test operation . 
teams made up of two reporters each accompanied by a photojournalist pretended to be party members , councillors , petitioners , supporters , or people in trouble eager to use the Easter holiday opportunity to show their gratitude or to boost their chances of seeing their problems solved . 
and they went knocking on several doors to present their gifts . 
what happened came as a terrible shock to us . 
except for a few number of officials , the elect showed stupefyingly open to accepting the gifts , acting as if it was the most natural thing like blinking or breathing . 
accepting a lamb from a party supporter is as much a commonplace as exchanging greetings is . 
wine bottle boxes , demijohns , lambs and other products of our transition agriculture were commonplace items on Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , when you could see convoys of cars from the provinces loaded with gifts parked outside the state institutions . 
some of these officials are in for a great surprise . 
we handed them envelopes containing all sorts of memorials and complaints sent to our editorial office . 
let 's hope they ' ll bother to lift a finger to solve them . 
the LEW operation ( lamb , eggs , wine ) showed us one more thing . 
MPs and public servants show A certain degree of irrationality when receiving hand - out . 
they don't ask themselves where these gifts come from , they don't consider for a moment they might get deseased or poisoned . 
they simply take them all , without the slightest worry . 
one of our reporters even exclaimed we could poison them all ! 
but the most complicated problem is related to morality . 
none of them wondered why they should accept a gift . 
which shows us we have to deal with a well consolidated reflex response . 
in Romania , the tradition of making such gifts dates back before the communist years . 
it 's a long - established natural thing . 
it 's a tradition to present gifts to your relatives . 
but public servants ' reflex acceptance of gifts is a totally different story . 
whether we like it or not , what we deal with in this case is a discreet form of corruption . 
nobody will incriminate it any longer . 
there 's a short way from a lamb and a bottle of wine to a colour TV set , a car , or an apartment . 
we shouldn't forget that in a civilized country a man ruined his political career as he failed to pay the taxes for his housemaid . 
in Romania , everybody 's appalled at the wide - spread corruption , but we give or take a lamb in gift as easy as giving or taking a ball - point pen . 
moreover , we ' ve reached the stage when a poor servant or an ordinary citizen who has to meet a high official feels uncomforatable to go empty - handed to the official in question . 
it often happens to us that readers who come to our editorial desk to ask for our support feel they should give us a gift . 
this is part of the Balkan mentality pattern , of a behavioural pattern with regulations that melt a way in irregularities . 
that 's the origin of arrangements , scams , law dodging and favouritism . 
if everything can be arranged when it comes to ordinary interaction , if a public servant accepts a trunkful of gifts without blinking , it means that all the other great and important things are beeing built on quick sands . 
instead of dwelling on topics like the world , life , death , and resurrection , these days we ' d rather dwell on duplicity . 
because we all subscribe to the idea of a cleaner social climate , but when it comes to living in observance of this principle we let ourselves be overcome by habits typical of small - natured mortals .
