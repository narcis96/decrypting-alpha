the president of the Moldovan Republic is probably changing wet towels every hour now . 
he drove himself in to a dead end where not even God can take him out of . 
Vladimir Voronin thought it would have been enough to have the power in order to do what whatever he pleased . 
he believed Moldovan citizens could be forced in to learning Russian so that they would be able to understand more easily his marvellous political thinking . 
he could not imagine that such a decision could have such a powerful impact in the souls of his fellow citizens speaking a language different from his own . 
and thus he found himself faced at first with 9,000 people who took it to the streets , and then with 15,000 . 
and what seemed like a mere growl against a decision taken in the education sector , after the brief suspension of the Christian Democratic Popular Party turned in to a large scale protest which came to be world wide known . 
it 's just that the one hundred thousand people gathered in Kishinev on Sunday were no longer protesting only in the name of the Romanian language . 
they had major political claims , early elections included . 
the proportions of the protests by the people in the Moldovan Republic inhibited the communist president 's self confidence . 
he is now forced to step back . 
no matter how much he would give in , he could no longer gain back the overwhelming percentage of electors who voted him one year ago . 
furthermore , the conditions when he took over have also changed . 
Moldovans ' living standard is as bad as always . 
the Moldovan Republic 's foreign debt , which matures this year , cannot be paid . 
relations with Romania are bad . 
with Ukraine , the same . 
ties with Moscow aren't too good , either , especially the economic ones , as Moldovans haven't got much to offer . 
there are no longer grounds for discussion with the IMF and the World Bank . 
relations with the Council of Europe have grown cold due to the blunders made by the communist administration . 
the outcome is sad . 
the authorities in Kishinev get suffocated in a close circle and can expect the situation but to worsen until the fatal moment of the collapse . 
a miraculous solution cannot pop up even if president Voronin gained the powers of a magician . 
what can Romania do ? 
it risks getting involved in an uninspired manner and suddenly founding itself in some major trouble the same year it has to take a decision regarding NATO expansion and at a moment when the European Union looks at us more carefully then ever . 
on one hand , Romania cannot distance itself from the protests related to the language and history common to all Romanians , and , on the other hand , it cannot break any of the recommendations of the European Council or an international document signed by Russia and the Moldovan Republic . 
by adopting a special attitude , may it be out of patriotism alone , Romania risks being perceived as having a questionable and dangerous behaviour . 
this is why the stand of the Romanian officials on the issue can be but in compliance with European regulations . 
furthermore , for a better understanding of things , each stand taking should be related to the paragraphs on an international document . 
by doing so , Romanian politicians could prove to the European community they are able to observe conventions and treaties even when it comes to affective involvement . 
at the same time , such a poised and fundamental attitude would bring Moscow in a position where it could no longer treat Romania like an involved and interested party . 
putting things more plainly , there would be no reason for Russia to change its relations with Romania over the situation in the Moldovan Republic . 
Romania cannot ignore the protesters in Kishinev , but no more can it help it beyond the boundaries of European regulations .
