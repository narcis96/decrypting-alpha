it wouldn't be fair to seal the guilt of Colonel Floricel Vitan and General in reserve Vasile Muresan arrested in Cluj city . 
only a final court ruling could confirm such an affirmation . 
but the two having been arrested is a fact . 
the first of them , Colonel Floricel Vitan , officer in a special service under the Justice Ministry , was caught by surprise right in the act of taking bribe . 
the fact leaves no room for doubt . 
prosecutors and witnesses took part in the sting operation , and Floricel Vitan is not a bank clerk , nor was he working as cashier to justify the cashing in of such a large amount of money . 
moreover , we ' ve learned from the press that in Cluj and at the Gherla penitentiary a system had been put in place to help convicts get released on medical grounds . 
while we were offered the popular show called " Luna " ( a large - scale police operation to fight corruption and organized crime , which lasted for two , three days , just the same as the assignment of some police crews to fixed locations in the city ) , in state institutions negotiations were under way with underworld figures , money was cashed in and the law was being bent . 
you think nobody knew about these things happening ? 
as long as the secret services forwarded a report on former penitentiary head Vasile Muresan to the presidency , it is to be assumed everybody knew , the Cluj inhabitants , the wardens at Gherla penitentiary and the locals in the neighbouring villages . 
only the sums needed to get the jail empty were missing . 
and had this money been found , the beds , the gates and the walls would probably have been sold . 
it 's an exaggeration , of course , but I only do it to point out to the proportions assumed by the phenomenon over the last eleven years . 
the arrest of the two officers by military prosecutors raises a little bit more the veil covering the corruption existent in state institutions . 
therefore , why do we keep wondering why Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's slogan " Down with the mafia ! " was such a success ? ! 
he enjoyed support because people are fed up with this sort of practices . 
people know better than the secret services , city workers , politicians and journalists that this kind of things do also happen in city halls , the government , with judges ( the dead people trials reported on by our colleagues on " Romania libera " daily are notorious ) , in ministries , at Prosecutor 's Offices , prefectures , police and politicians in or outside the parliament . 
it 's about a phenomenon that appalls both the European Union , and foreign investors , and poor Romanian citizens . 
it widely proliferated after 1990 , and the responsibility for this phenomenon lies with the entire political class . 
the political class has tolerated and often stimulated the formation of cancer tumors in state institutions . 
it 's possible that these days when the handover of power is under way we may witness some settling of accounts . 
moreover , we could think this is the reason behind the dismantling of the crime ring in Cluj . 
but this seems less important to me . 
so much the better if crows are plucking out one another 's eyes ! 
we have a different problem resulting from the polls on November 26 . 
the massive support enjoyed by the man who promised to root out corruption and mafia compels the PDSR to take firm measures in this respect . 
not to throw dust in people 's eyes , or trying to nail their political opponents as some of the current power politicians may be tempted to do . 
it 's about the corrupt people in every institution , usually regulars of some political party , and about those appointed to run these fundamental mechanisms of the state . 
if the PDSR is going to settle political scores by ostentatiously arresting some people of the former power and let the mess in the state institutions grow in proportions , then that will be the end of us ! 
but if credible , clean people known for their honesty are to be appointed to run these institutions , then we will see a fresh climate setting in , a different attitude towards the law . 
in fact , through the people they place in the decision - making centres of our society the PDSR is laying the qualitative foundation of its performance . 
it is now that the PDSR is building the premise for a successful governing or for failure . 
if fellows like Bebe Ivanovici , Dan Iosif and Gabriel Bivolaru are to set the trend , then we won't have any reason to wonder that we haven't made any progress and that the very next occasion extremism will enjoy a far wider support . 
convicts released from jail by officers - this seems to me the most shocking picture of the state institutions ' decay . 
this should be the starting point of the fresh power 's activity !
