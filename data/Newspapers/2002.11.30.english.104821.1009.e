stop overheating the remote control ! 
there 's no point switching to another channel . 
the other ones are broadcasting commercials as well . 
that 's not their fault . 
ads are coming through the wire , the air , from everywhere . 
tv broadcasts are loaded with ads to the highest limit allowed under the law . 
and there 's nothing you can do about that . 
you have no choice but swallow in bulk prizes , tombolas , make - up , cars , long - lasting consumer goods , average - lasting goods , anything . 
state farms , insurance policies , trips , devices to curl your chest hair . 
don't let your imagination run wild ! 
this TV commercial flood doesn't mean the channels concerned make a sackful of money in ad revenues . 
quite the contrary . 
the high number of commercials is a sign of despair . 
tv stations have proliferated like mushrooms . 
lots of little mice have gathered on a slice of Swiss cheese , besides the big consumers . 
and they are diligently chewing at it . 
that is , they offer commercial spaces for free or for the equivalent of three marmalade jars even for salami sandwich ads . 
tv stations have come to sell ad spaces at lower rates than radio stations . 
what does that mean ? 
sort of hunger . 
every year in Romania , approximately the money equivalent of three packs of fine cigarettes per capita is spent on advertising . 
a mere trifle compared to other Central and East European countries , where the figure is seven times higher . 
a market not worth a penny , as the grumbling Romanian would put it . 
and 13 television stations , not three or four , are fighting over this market not worth a penny or worth three packs of fine cigarettes per each Romanian . 
and new TV stations are going to be set up soon . 
the old slice of cheese is now heavily overcrowded . 
the competition has brought TV station owners in to the situation of stripping themselves before big consumers . 
for a penny , they cut down rates to the level where some TV stations can no longer survive on the money they make . 
speaking in economic terms , the phenomenon shouldn't bother us . 
after all , it 's the owners ' business if TV stations offer ad spaces at low rates or in exchange for chestnuts . 
but this loss - making business is also done at TV viewers ' expense . 
they are forced to swallow these segments of time in the form of sausage - long commercials that have come to cause exasperation . 
during a commercial break in the evening you can run to the store at the corner of your street , or go visit your friend or go to a TV headquarters to drop them a message the phone lines turned hot with so many curses and protests can no longer take . 
what 's to be done ? 
big companies interested in placing ads are glad as they can enjoy cheap ad campaigns . 
who after all isn't thrilled with the fools ' fierce competition ? 
the TV stations , most of them set up under the urge of investors ' vain egos , don't gain anything . 
on the contrary , they lose . 
consequently , they end up being kept . 
what for ? 
could it be such a big pride in owning a TV station that loses money ? 
this explanation too has a catch . 
small TV stations are losing , and so are viewers . 
but what happens when elections come ? 
then they are making good their loss . 
the cardboard billionaires rent air time for political attacks , mudslinging and bombastic speeches . 
they take the money out of their wallets and pay . 
so they protect themselves against potential police raids . 
or they use this opportunity to make a Dimbovita - style bargain . 
you give us this , we let you say that and we ' ll stay friends . 
hungry little mice are squeaking on all channels . 
don't switch to another channel , there 's nowhere you can run . 
it goes the same for all TV stations . 
and there 's no point going for a walk . 
for a penny , you ' ll see the painted billboards , listen to the radio , get the magazines and newspapers and still come a cross the same thing . 
ads , ads , ads ! 
at least on TV , that 's about the only merchandise in Romania supplied for free .
