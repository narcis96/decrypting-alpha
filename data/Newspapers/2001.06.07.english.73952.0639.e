could general Mircea Chelaru be such a pious man ? 
could he be one of those people who keep a little cross in their pocket all the time and make the sign of the cross every ten steps ? 
and assuming he is one of those people who always keep God in their thoughts , why did he have to go to church exactly the day when Marshal Antonescu 's bust statue was unveiled ? 
real believers usually don't pray in a loud voice . 
could the general be so pious and at the same time such a great admirer of the Marshal ? 
and supposing he went to the church in Bariera Vergului neighbourhood in Bucharest for both purposes , what happened next , he lost courage and couldn't find the power in his heart to admit what he had done and tried to pretend something else ? 
could general Chelaru be so silly as not to think that in his capacity as a high ranking officer and former chief of staff his presence at such a ceremony was sending out a signal more dangerous than his sincere admiration for a historical figure ? 
could it be that we had a weak - minded chief of staff with a poor ability to assess a situation ? 
then why did Emil Constantinescu appoint him to that office ? 
for his military merits ? 
was pressure put on him to make the appointment ? 
could general Chelaru be the same general Chelaru who was a member of CADA ( the committee for the democratization of the army ) ? 
is the former chief of staff the same Chelaru who was the head of the counterespionage division under the Romanian Intelligence Service ? 
why was he " extracted " from that position ? 
is he the same Chelaru who worked at the Military Intelligence Division ( DIM ) and was later sent to Jordan as an undercover agent ? 
it is said that in Jordan that Chelaru was caught smuggling whisky and sent home . 
rumours circulated within the intelligence services have it that a certain officer Chelaru had allegedly been given a full trimming service ( shave , hair cut , pomade ) by the Russian intelligence services . 
the believer , the CADA member , the counterespionage officer and the former chief of staff are one and the same person or are we dealing with different persons ? 
and if all these people were one and the same person , how could Emil Constantinescu swallow such a yarn ? 
was he duped by somebody or was his idea to rehabilitate an acquaintance or some remote relative ? 
could the pious and faithful Chelaru be the same Chelaru dismissed from the army ? 
unfortunately , as we don't have access to all the records we can't get an answer to these questions . 
we even kindly ask our readers not to jump to conclusions before seeing all the evidence in this case . 
like it or not , they will certainly ask themselves whether of all these Chelaru generals , the one who attended the statue unveiling ceremony a long with Corneliu Vadim Tudor was exactly the one " shaved " by the Russian intelligence services . 
and what if they didn't do it because they were irresponsible , but because they wanted to show the Americans that in Romania there are politicians , and high ranking officers , and even an important former army head who are still loyal to the spirit of Marshal Antonescu ? 
could it be that both the politician , and the poet , and the general wanted to show not their admiration for a historical figure , but rather wanted to defy the Americans so as to give them to understand there 's no point in troubling their heads over Romania 's integration with NATO or any other structure ? 
some of these Chelaru persons I don't consider either believers , or fools . 
my feeling is they are shaved , have their hair cut and put pomade on . 
were they on a job mission ?
