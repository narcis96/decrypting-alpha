no matter how hot the weather may be , if the workers from Galati - based iron and steel mill Sidex take to the streets , supported by the steelworkers from Resita and Hunedoara , the atmosphere will become really heated . 
today in Galati , thousands of people will go on a rally and will stage a protest demonstration . 
the trade unionists say that they stage the protests only because of the pension law . 
let 's say they are right . 
it is unacceptable that a steelworker , after a life of very hard work , will retire with a very low pension . 
from this point of view , their wish to get better retirement conditions seems fair to me . 
it 's just that the attempt to press for the amendment of the pension law now , when the privatization contract of Sidex is about to be signed , seems a bit suspect . 
even if the protests that are to be staged today are " clean " , meaning they are aimed only at the above - mentioned law , their consequences can still be unfortunate . 
first , the Galati inhabitants have MPs in parliament , have a prefect , and the steelworkers are organized in a trade union . 
they could have first tried to address the issue by these means . 
if all the steelworkers gather together , an amendment to the pension law will have to be adopted eventually . 
but to take to the streets exactly on the days when the selloff contract should be signed and to threaten that the social pact with the government would be cancelled , is more like some nails hammered right in to the sole of the Galati inhabitants and the Romanians . 
what I want to say is not necessarily that the trade unions in Galati are driven by all sorts of hidden interests of those who will have to lose because of the Sidex privatization . 
but I am ready to bet my bottom dollar that a part from the profiters that have held offices in institutions the past eleven years of corruption , and shell companies , there are also some top unionist leaders . 
this does not seem essential to me . 
it is more important that this " black hole " of national interest be finally privatized . 
with a bribe or not , we cannot consider the sale conditions honorable , advantageous or shady as long as they have not been made public in detail . 
but the privatization of the Galati - based iron and steel mill Sidex is a key moment in the evolution of the Romanian economy . 
it will take a huge pressure off the budget . 
once privatized , Sidex will leave important amounts of money in the state budget that can be allotted to the health sector , the culture and the army . 
besides , it is a major signal given by the current government . 
the wavering attitude of the Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) during the electoral period ends in a determined move beneficial to the market economy . 
from the Sidex privatization not only the workers , the city , and the county would have to gain . 
Romania would gain too ! 
i am making these statements without any intention to give anybody a political score and without having an exact knowledge of the terms of privatization , but with the hope that we will not witness a scheme of huge proportions . 
in this context , the industrial action in Galati , even only aimed at the pension law , comes in a very bad moment . 
it could trigger doubts and worries , it could postpone the signing of the selloff contract . 
moreover , if today 's rally degenerates in to something else , then we can kiss a foreign investor goodbye . 
the " black hole " of national interest will continue to be covered with the money with each Romanian citizen . 
today in Galati , we can condemn ourselves to a catastrophe !
