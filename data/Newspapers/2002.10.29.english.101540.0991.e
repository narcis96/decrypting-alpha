tough weekend , like the days that followed September 11 . 
the capital cities of the two great powers of the world can now breathe freely . 
in Washington , people have returned to the streets , in parks and other public places after the snipers had been caught . 
a Chechen commando entered a theatre and took over 800 hostages , asking in return the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechenia . 
the situation was paralysing . 
Washington and Moscow , the nervous centres of military giants , were in a state of shock caused by terrorism . 
the USA put in motion troops whose seize was hard to assess , which triggered a real psychosis . 
a truck driver eventually signalled the presence of two suspects sleeping in a parking lot in Maryland . 
two insane men who managed to make 13 victims of whom 10 dead . 
in Moscow , things were quite different . 
there was neither the paranoid set on sending anthrax letters , nor the crazy couple shooting from a boot . 
Moscow was hit by a political terrorism , something resembling the events on September 11 , but without planes . 
however , it also happened in a big urban agglomeration and it also took its toll from among innocent people . 
in vane did the secret services and the police surveyed the subway entrance . 
the hit didn't take place either on Lujniki stadium nor in the Red Square . 
terrorism has reached a place nobody would have though of . 
in a theatre , during a show watched by hundreds of children , women , foreigners , a place of no strategic or symbolic importance . 
it was only the number of hostages that counted during the terrorist attempt in Moscow . 
however , there are also differences . 
the snipers ended up asking for money . 
the Chechens demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from their territory . 
in Washington , the criminals were caught without casualties . 
in Moscow , the special troops entered the building after having used paralysing gas . 
there were 118 hostages and 50 terrorists who died during confrontations ( if the figures stay unchanged ) . 
it 's a big number , but there was the risk for it to exceed 800 ( in case the Chechens had had the chance to blow up the building ) . 
the terror in the two great capital cities of the world late last week does but to draw attention once more on this phenomenon . 
the means are ever changing , with the price always to be paid by innocent people . 
lives in exchange for money or political purposes that went beyond negotiations ' limits . 
the consequences : a feeling of insecurity reaching its climax in big urban agglomerations , regardless of religion , society or stakes . 
there is a huge difference between a desperate people and a nutcase , which is impossible to control by logical , legal or educational means . 
the end of last week ads to the effects of a phenomenon and forces us all , from average people to politicians and big power leaders , to meditate upon a problem that is hard to solve by organisational decisions . 
cancer or AIDS , with a little luck , can be prevented easier from a laboratory . 
terrorism is still far from having an antidote as long as human lives are but a mere trade currency .
