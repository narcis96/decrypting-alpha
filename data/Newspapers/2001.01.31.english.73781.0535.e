the pie is stale . 
it 's been in the tray for two days , with a piece of wire in it to which the price tag is attached . 
it looks like a cube of second - rate yellow soap . 
I wonder whether it is fresh , says a woman with a shabby mink coat on . 
she came by the 6 o ' clock train to see her daughter who 's in hospital . 
a little gipsy boy slashes her purse with a razor and gets his fingers in to the purse trying to sneak the woman 's wallet . 
the shop assistant turns a blind eye to the scene . 
she too could get slashed if she starts screaming . 
the wallet is passed to another gipsy kid who on his way hands it to a third gipsy kid in the crowd . 
in a few hours , the woman from some place in the country will find herself begging for money in a tube station , either at the Intercontinental entry to the tube in the centre of Bucharest or at Piata Victoriei ( Victory Square ) station . 
she 's get two thousand lei from two compassionate persons and then a third person will snap at her go get some job , damn you ! 
she will spend the night under the staircase in some block of flats or on the hospital 's hallway next to the door of the ward where her sick daughter sleeps . 
she was operated on for appendicitis , while in fact she was suffering from gall bladder disorder . 
in the middle of the sidewalk , where the woman 's wallet was passed from thin - fingered hands to thick - fingered hands , there 's a man standing and looking back . 
he noticed some eyes he had seen before , some mouth that reminds him of another mouth he had seen before in some other place and the man bumps his shoulder in to two ladies walking arm in arm . Watch your steps , you ox ! 
what 's the matter , ma ' am , have I killed you ? 
says the man overcome with astonishment at the ladies ' violent reaction . 
and then suddenly he gets hit by a hail of machine gun fire coming from the two ladies : sod off , old tramp ! 
the men feels his veins swelling with the rush of blood , he ' d go looking for a policeman or slap the woman in the face , but that is no way to treat a woman , he would seize her by her coat collar and shake her telling her ma ' am , I ' m a university professor ! 
but there 's no one he can talk with , there 's no person around on whose face he can see a shadow of sympathy and to whom he can justify himself and shake off the smear on his soul caused by those offensive words . 
but he 's got nobody to talk with as blank , dark - complexioned , frowning and unconcerned faces pass him by like some pig iron figures engaged in a parade of grotesque masks . 
you ' d think no ray of light has ever touched those faces , that no smile has ever made them look beautiful . 
and the professor at the Polytechnic University bursts in to tears . 
he feels breathless as he is choking on his powerless rage . 
at the University bus stop , a teenager carrying a back bag gets at the front of the bus right near the driver . 
why didn't you stop at Kogalniceanu station ? 
will you pay for my missed private tuition class ? 
you cheeky boy , what did you say ?? 
i asked you why you didn't stop at ... Everybody on the bus can hear the smack sound made by the driver slapping the boy 's face red with fury . 
the driver comes out from behind the bar separating him from the rest of the bus , grasps the boy by his back bag and throws him out in the street . 
he shuts the automatic doors and takes off with a jerky motion . 
at a crossroads he cracks the rear mirror of a Jeep . 
Damn you and your Jeeps ! , he says while speeding to Piata Rosetti ( Rosetti Square ) . 
it 's a mean world , man , very mean ! , says an old lady holding her purse close to her chest . 
at the minibus station , a family jumps the queue . 
the rest of the passengers start swearing . 
some people are so thick - skinned ! 
leave them alone , man , they 're in a hurry ! 
i ' m in a hurry too ! 
they could at least asked for our permission ! 
the man and his wife are looking out of the windows . 
they hear and see nothing . 
a man hits the window pane of a sweetshop with his shopping bag in which he carries two cabbages . 
the fat cabbages are smiling from among the broken pane pieces and the passers by startled by the noise turn their heads to see what happened . 
what the hell has gotten in to the man with the cabbage that made him break the window pane ? 
the man is in about the same mood as the bus driver . 
the same wrecked nerves that make the professor burst in to tears because of his powerlessness , the same helplessness similar to that of a puppy caged in a metal garbage bin felt by the woman left without money and ID in a city where her daughter 's life is all that matters to her . 
A dreadful alienation born of fear , of poverty , of an almost wild survival instinct . 
you no longer see a man smiling and cheerfully greeting a woman , or a man taking off his hat in respect for a lady or an acquaintance , you no longer see that hand nicely stretched out in what wants to mean this way , please , you no longer can see the smile on the face of a driver stopping to let you cross the street . 
you can see nothing of the kind any longer , only the silent fight for an extra square millimeter , for an extra penny , for a promotion , sort of a crazy race with everybody trying to trample everybody under foot , a race fueling our illusion that we ' ll attain our goals faster , without realizing that our lives have turned in to sort of a fumbling about in the dark lacking any direction , sense or cause . 
there 's no room for any logic or generosity in any gesture and no time to contemplate the life 's beauties . 
everything boils down to elbowing , jostling , foul words , grumbling , kicking , smacking , accusations , resentments , acrimony , and we fail to realize that imperceptibly our face bones start sticking out through our cheeks , our jaws become prolonged , our teeth start to stretch from our mouths , and when we get loose a cross the border the kids who happen to see us dig one another in the ribs saying watch those people , they look so much like prey animals !
