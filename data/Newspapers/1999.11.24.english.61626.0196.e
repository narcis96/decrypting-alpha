for some days , finance minister Decebal Traian Remes has been telling us that we 're going to see some tax relaxation next year . 
but don't jump to conclusions ! 
so far , he hasn't gone in to details . 
he gripped his tie leaving us to guess whether he wanted to hang himself or just unbutton his shirt , turned his head to the right then to the left with a jerk and made the announcement that was supposed to fill us with hope . 
god , what a gorgeous life we 're going to have ! 
taxes will go down , goods will go cheaper , companies will flourish ! 
one could think we ' ll be better off than Americans . 
but I ' d say we should keep cool . 
happiness is still far a way . 
which doesn't mean Remes ' statement is not funny . 
because what he promises us is rather a circus show . 
we tried to find out some details about the much trumpeted tax relaxation . 
most Finance Ministry officials we asked about the planned tax relaxation knew nothing about it . 
they had heard about it on TV or from press reports . 
therefore , the great news announced by the Romanian accountant exists only in his mind . 
or he may have told a friend or a fellow Liberal about it . 
that 's all we know . 
but what is this statement based on ? 
has the finance minister identified new ways to finance the state budget ? 
does he count on important amounts of money from abroad ? 
or has Traian Decebal Remes turned in to a finance wizzard mastering witchcraft like Iosefini , if not David Copperfield ? ! 
i think none of the above - mentioned possibilities are real . 
the budget revenues keep drying exactly because of the absurd financial mechanism designed by the accountant born in Maramures . 
and he can't perform any magic tricks , as he would have done so by now . 
when he took over the Finance Ministry and tried to impose taxes on tuition and on seats in pubs I thought he was going to boost budget revenues by collecting all due taxes . 
at that time he also promised to take firm measures to uproot corruption . 
and we saw Remes taking measure after measure , rushing decree after decree through the government , and amending regulations until he got all the business community in Romania totally confused . 
the finance chaos became proverbial . 
not long ago I listened to Remes advocating fresh regulations on cigarette taxes . 
it 's the eighth time this year . 
and that moment I realized Romania has a finance minister who 's way of thinking is similar to that of an accountant keeping the books of a kiosk . 
no policy , no strategy . 
only the muscle flexing of an unskilled man ready to headlong rush in to a wall and crush his skull against it . 
he introduced a new cigarette taxing policy which sent budget revenues dropping . 
actually , his incompetence has turned finances in to a mess and stuck yet another nail in to the finances coffin . 
in a month or two , Remes will have to revise up taxes a gain . 
and instead of adopting a modern line of thinking , he will surely come up with an absurd invention that would further lower tax collections . 
In fact , he deals with the Romanian economy as if it were the balance sheet of a small private company in Maramures , speaking with the fraud inspectors ( the IMF ) , quarrelling with the firm 's employees ( the trade unions ) devising a fresh fund ( pushing up some prices ) and wondering why in the end the balance sheet is always showing a loss . 
Decebal Traian Remes has probably read the US Treasury study to estimate the Romanian underground economy . 
but instead of learning something from the first paragraph , that is the motto saying that " underground economy is first of all a sign of the government 's weakness " , and tendering his resignation , Remes read only the introduction to the study . 
and learned that black market economy is triggered by " inappropriate tax systems and excessive state intervention in economy . 
" and instead of calling the few experts he has available and examine the real possibilities of fiscal relaxation and the effects of such measures , the minister went public with the news . 
he doesn't know where he 's going to take the money from , he doesn't know how the IMF will react , he has no strategy . 
and given the above - mentioned , we are inclined to think this is about yet another political soap bubble . 
once a gain he talks our heads off and makes empty promises so that we can peacefully sink deeper in to the mud . 
though Liberals continue to support him ( though it 's hard to see the connection between the finance minister and the Liberal policy ) , Traian Decebal Remes is the best example substantiating the statement made by " Oriflame " company manager to Romania Mrs Monica Tatoiu : " The Finance Ministry is the only Romanian body where incompetence accounts for 99 percent of the personnel 
the only employees left are those nobody else would have .
