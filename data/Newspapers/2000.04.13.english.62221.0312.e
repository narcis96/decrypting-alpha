at the " Invest Romania Forum " in New York , the president of the Banca Romana de Dezvoltare bank Bogdan Baltazar was saying he was waiting for big American investors to grant them credits . 
Banca Romana de Dezvoltare , turned private in 1998 , can offer advantageous loans to strong American firms . 
in the Roosevelt Hotel hall there were also present managers of Romanian state - run firms , some of them in a difficult position , as well as managers of private companies . 
you can imagine the look on their face ! 
they had come all the way to New York to find business partners , finance sources or people and firms willing to get involved in the privatisation of some commercial companies only to learn that the money they dreamt of could be available in Bucharest , too . 
when hearing this statement , some of the Romanians who had pinned their hopes on the forum even started to grumble . 
why won't you give it to us , as we need the money ? 
they simply could not understand how such a thing could happen . 
Bogdan Baltazar elegantly dodged the question . 
he was running the risks of turning the talks in to a typically Romanian debate one cannot make head or tail of , a debate that would have puzzled the Americans present in the hall . 
the Americans would have understood nothing of all this or they would have understood that something was being told in New York and a completely different thing was going on in Bucharest . 
Bogdan Baltazar 's statement is not as paradoxical as it seems . 
it conceals a not too pleasant state of affairs . Serious banks are assaulted by depositors . 
foreign capital banks , even small , are preferred , based on credibility criteria , although they do not offer the highest interest rates . 
however , a foreign bank in Romania won't find too many placement opportunities . 
what is it supposed to do ? 
keep purchasing treasury bonds ? 
to whom should it give the money ? 
this is no laughing matter ! 
how is a bank to know that the institution or the man before the teller applying for a saving loan won't vanish for good after being released the credit ? 
all the bureaucratic mechanism devised to limit the number of " accidents " has only managed to cause such cases to multiply . 
it 's no point mentioning the favours , bribe , political interventions . 
a serious bank knows that on a market like the Romanian one it is almost impossible to abide by the obligations . 
a new tax will be introduced , the purchasing power will drop , legislation will vary , a partner of the partner will vanish , so the machinery will stall . 
as to the money , the bank may whistle for it ! 
how and where from could money be recouped ? 
in the USA , everybody will chase you to recoup money . 
if you are a private person with a loan to reimburse , you will actually live fearing that you won't be able to pay it back . 
the idea that you might lose your job and no longer be able to pay back will make you much more disciplined . 
you will sweat blood and won't grumble over any remark . 
in Romania things are getting ever more complicated where commercial companies are concerned . 
workers won't care where the money comes from , what matters is that they get pay raises . 
this also works for the company director ( manager ) , who may be replaced before the reimbursement of the debt . 
then why should he waste this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity ? 
so he will find a trick that will bring him some gain . 
besides , the business plan submitted with the bank will no longer be valid , as things will repeatedly change from the day you submitted it to the day the loan is released and eventually to the day you start selling and making money . 
even if your calculations are accurate , they will no longer be valid . 
hence the conclusion : transition is the ideal period for cashing in money and trying not to give it back . 
transition is the period during which Razvan Temesan , despite the nonsensical decisions he made which led to the bankruptcy of a bank , is still being seen by his political masters as a great banker . 
George Constantin Paunescu , despite his having been the main " nail " in the Bancorex and Bankcoop coffin , is seen as a big businessman and can hardly wait to see the party of his heyday win the elections so that he will start over the financial schemes . 
then how is a bank ( unless state - run , that is nobody 's bank ) supposed to grant loans without getting burnt ? 
should it issue loans to a state - owned firm with billion lei worth of debts or to a limited company with its office in an apartment ? 
Bogdan Baltazar 's answer in New York should have been as simple as this : a bank should grant credits to investors , American or British , German or of any other citizenship for whom paying debts is a creed . 
the grumble of the Romanian businessman conceals the " first we should be granted this and that , then we ' ll think about what we should do " mentality . 
at least while in New York they should have found out that the main reason for being avoided by investors is first and foremost related to the mentalities in Romania , which show in laws , in conduct , in efficiency . 
one of the Romanians present at the forum even told me on the hallway : " You won't believe what one of these people asked me ! 
he wanted to know how much above 30 percent his gain could be if he put money in our factory . 
dam ' fool , doesn't he know that I ' m struggling to stay alive ?
