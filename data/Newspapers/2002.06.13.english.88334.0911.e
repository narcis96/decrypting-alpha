do you know how big the French people 's pride is ? 
or the moments following the winning of the World Championship or the European Championship , when the crowd poured onto the Champs Elysees like snow melted by overheating of the Alps in the winter . 
and if you felt or had a hunch of how big France 's ego is , then you should also try to understand how big the sorrow can be now ! 
the team that dominated the end of the past millennium and for which a sort of a temple - stadium was built in Paris returns home from the Far East like an army in disgrace . 
it seems like even a Napoleon coming back from a battle barefooted and without a horse would be easier to understand . 
today 's France hasn't got just a sole general . 
it 's a platoon of generals led by a wounded prince . 
it 's not just a defeat of the Gallic Cock . 
it 's an unprecedented blemish of the high - class football in Italy , spain , England and France , where " the cocks " serve under all colours of football glory . 
France 's ranking last in its group and with no goal scored in the entire Asian expedition sound even more bitter than the " Waterloo ' episode and the frozen blood when flags had to be bent in Borodino . 
France 's being eliminated from the world championship without scoring at least a honorary goal is a matchless sportive fall . 
it is also unfair and merciless . 
it turns sports in to a metaphor and a reason for meditation . 
the difference between the hundreds of thousands of French who took to the streets to welcome their heroes four years ago and today 's sorrow gives birth to a lesson of life which only real men can go all the way through . 
how much is the France 's soccer team worth in money and diamonds ? 
! yet , with all their names that may cast shadow on heads of state , famous artists , valuable sportsmen or rich people , France was not able to score a goal or defeat Senegal 's national soccer team , whose history they changed , offered it a coach and now they launch its players ! 
Zinedine Zidane , the one who 's worth the equivalent of his weight in gold multiplied a few times and for whom another national team would be worth setting up in the future , showed but a three or four pale little flowers . 
Thierry Henry was eliminated like a C division eighty - year old man , Barthez wasn't able to show more than a suffering buttock , and Marcel Desailly looked like an African sheikh 's son lost in an unknown world . 
when Djorkaeff entered the field , he looked like a grandpa who just got out of his rocking chair to prevent the vessels from drowning . 
it was too late because everything was going on under the sign of misfortune . 
a disaster was meant to be , and it was implacably happening in order to fulfil a law . 
there are no emperors in football and in sports . 
glory lasts as long as health , brains and luck do . 
there are no powers beyond reach nor are there any sentenced players without a last chance . 
in football , one can enrapture continents as well as go through the loneliness of a suicidal man . 
football is revenge , boldness paid with tears and also modern industry vulnerable to average human weaknesses . 
let 's thank God for not punishing us with being French and , for one week , go through the pains which would give birth to another team . 
to the glory of France and the beauty of football !
