Radu Vasile is such a nuisance to politicians ! 
no matter what proposition you may present him for consideration , he will say yes before you get to finish your sentence . 
he will give assurances , smile , spice the conversation with a joke , take your arm and share with you his sorrows as if you were at least his blood brother . 
whenever he 's in a nice fix , he will chew on his moustache , blink jokingly and produce from his sleeve sort of a cure - all omelette solution . 
and once the discussion is over , he will happily rub his hands and tell someone who happens to be around man , can you imagine them asking for such a nonsense ! 
let 's play a chess game ! 
and he will completely forget what he has promissed . 
his actor and first class practical joker character makes him hate tough confrontations . 
he will sow seeds of discord , put a spoke in somebody 's wheel , unexpectedly pick at someone and then will go back to his place innocently watching the effects of his move just like a jester . 
he will not quarrel with the trade unions . 
he will undermine them and then feel sorry for them . 
he will not stand up against the senior members of his party , but will ruthlessly and diligently pull behind - the - scene strings against them . 
and he knows how to handle those of his own generation or younger than him , either by having a good word for each of them or by assigning them to fulfil suicidal tasks for him that give juniors a sense of selfimportance . He is a football fan and excellent party and political meeting company and all these make him a character you could neither kill , nor get rid of . 
he will get in to your house through the window , go all over the place and crack jokes . 
he 's rather kind of a local Falstaff , thinner than the original but overflowing with wit . 
should you hire him to do a job on a daily basis , he would surely find one thousand ways to take your money and leave the garden unworked . 
he will never embark on any difficult undertaking and has the skill to dodge all difficult situations . 
in fact , Radu Vasile 's great art lies in his talent of emerging unscathed from any situation . 
as a matter of fact , Radu Vasile has proved in a rather short time that he has few prime minister qualities , but a lot of politician talents . 
Radu Vasile shouldn't be allowed to manage a company , as he wouldn't be able to produce as little as to cover the staff wages . 
this thing simply bores him . 
but once you introduce him to a group of people , he will manage to talk them out of their believes until they no longer know what they really want and he will bring them all to a common denominator . 
what I mean is that I have no confidence in his administrative or managerial vocation , but I can't overlook his performamce as political orchestrator . 
because from some unimportant Christian Democratic Party member he has become a prime minister , has managed to get out from under Emil Constantinescu 's tutorship and slowly but surely plans to take over the party 's leadership . 
we have no other choice but admit that his ability to talk everybody 's head off in a moment when nobody wanted him is the most convincing sign that , following the typical local political pattern , the current premier is a first class artist . 
Radu Vasile 's statement on his possible candidacy for the Christian Democratic Party 's leadership is like feeding some twigs to a fire to keep it smouldering . 
he makes the junior party members pin their hopes on him , while causing the seniors to get defensive or pensive . 
he also helped Remus Opris emerge from his cocoon , which put a slippery look in the latter 's weasel eyes . 
the Christian Democrats , who claim they are the great defenders of democracy , pretend to talk about their congress , though the last time they held it was when Adam was a boy . 
which shows us it is easier for them to enforce democracy on the others than on themselves . 
the party whose stammering governing policies pushed it in a tight corner pretends now not to remember its promise and its statutory obligation of holding a congress at regular intervals . 
the Christian Democrats seem set not to break their stillness , just as they did in the case of their disputes with their partners in the Democatic Convention . 
because stillness is the only guarantee that the party won't break . 
and in this situation Radu Vasile comes up with an offer and proves once a gain that he is a poor manager , but an excellent card gambler . 
if he manages to render his term in office meaningful , to score some points and show moderation in his juggling , then he really stands a chance to take over the party 's leadership . 
after all , why shouldn't an elf be preferable to a chorus of oldsters who already see their seats as some statue pedestals ?
