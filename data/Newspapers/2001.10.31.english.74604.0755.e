" that which has been is that which will be . And that which has been done is that which will be done . So , there is nothing new under the sun . 
is there anything of which one might say " See this , it is new " ? Already it has existed for ages which were before us " , says the Ecclesiastes , the pessimism foundation stone . 
that also holds good when it comes to corruption or anti - corruption matters . 
we ' ve seen both . 
facts and programmes . 
the Roman kings , the Ottoman sultans , the kings of France and the tsars of the Russian Empire , they all had to face corruption and tried to root it out . 
the only difference is they didn't develop programmes to fight corruption . 
those programmes were first produced as a great piece of work in the days of Nicolae Ceausescu ( urging us to live in the spirit of " the Code of Socialist Ethics and Equity " ! ) . 
and later a programme to fight corruption was drawn up under Emil Constantinescu 's rule . 
the most serious accusations were made at the time . 
people made fun and soon got bored of all that fuss over fighting corruption . 
but corruption accusations went on after the changeover of power , reaching miles and miles a way . 
as a matter of fact , rotten people and rottenness have for some time become Romania 's " emblem " . 
wherever abroad you happen to go , you are told the same thing . 
such being the case , our good government started right a way to develop an anti - corruption plan and programme . 
the not long ago announced document is to be made public and taken under thorough debate . 
the other day we were sent a draft copy of the document to express our opinion on it . 
as I can't see why I should write twice about the same thing , I hurry up to convey hereby some opinions on the text to the Justice Ministry . 
first of all , I want to say the text of the project is really funny . 
" the civilization of the third millennium is faced with a dilemma : to carry on a repressive policy of social control or to amplify the consensual and multisectorial practices of preventing corruption " . 
this dilemma is not only puzzling , but has no solution either . 
but as the governing programme ( used to illustrate some pages full of nice quotations " ) does contain a solution , the only thing left to do is get the fight started . 
" this clear political will advocates the need for the launching of the offensive on the corruption prevention front and aims at reducing the opportunities for committing corruption crimes and at obstacling ( sic ! ) an extremely hazardous evolution . " 
it 's clear ! 
ma ' am Chirita with her taste for barbarisms is also part of the great dilemma of the millennium . 
you know what victory depends on ? 
" the successful implementation depends on the joint ( joint = conjugate in Romanian ) steps taken by the state institutions " . 
undoubtedly , in the great effort of fighting the political disease of the millennium , the trouble comes from " conjugation " . 
imagine a prefect or a police top figure looking dumbstruck in the mirror or at his subordinates and asking " how the hell do steps conjugate in the second person singular and plural ? 
" do you know where the draft says there is corruption ? 
everywhere , you 're probably inclined to say . 
wrong guess ! 
there is corruption in the legislative body , the central or local public institutions , the justice system and the political parties . 
but not in the government ! 
god forbid ! 
how could the government make a National Corruption Prevention Programme and a National Action Plan against Corruption while speaking about corruption within itself ? 
what do you want ? 
see the government fight the executive ? 
it 's clear ! 
the wording of the draft is hilarious , figures don't add up , many of the envisaged measures are old news . 
get down to work and write it a gain ! 
maybe something new will come out ! 
though the Ecclesiastes says ... go back to the beginning of my column .
