a motion is a sort of nail . 
you hammer it in to the power here and there , but you can't get very high . 
you don't have arguments , nobody believes you ( and you are even mocked at ) , and efficiency is zero . 
you can try whenever you want . 
a nail hammered in to the floor is not a motion . 
but a nail beaten higher , in to the wall or the heart , might have strong consequences . 
sometimes it can lead to the fall of power ( when a motion of no confidence against the government is passed ) . 
the motion announced by the Liberals and the Democrats was not aimed at ousting the Nastase government . 
it would rebound on its initiators . 
in order to cause a drama for Adrian Nastase , now at the height of his 70 percent credibility ratings , the two small parties should have put eight - nine chairs one on top of the other in order to cling to the neck of the premier . 
any Romanian knows that the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) and the Democratic Party ( PD ) are too small at the moment to accomplish such a task . 
their persistent attempt to submit a motion is like a naive squeaking from the corner of a building . 
squeak - squeak , the elephant is passing by and someone must protest ! 
what is embarrassing in the attempt to beat a nail in to the sole of the Nastase government is negligence . 
the two parties have been working on it for a few days and finally they got stuck in to a procedure issue . 
they presented the motion on the day when the Chamber of Deputies does not work in plenary sessions ( the schedule has been in force for ten years ) , and the document can be submitted ( according to regulations ) only to the president of the chamber during a public meeting . 
it 's like an absent - minded student who goes to school on Sunday to take a maths test . 
this detail , besides the funny side of the situation , has the merit of showing us a more important thing . 
we do not have an opposition . 
Romania is ruled by a power which nobody opposes . 
considering the small number of MP seats the two parties have in parliament , they don't matter . 
besides , the way in which they move shows us they are small and fat . 
i mean the parties from which we should expect somewhat restlessness as a reaction to the slowness with which the power acts , are still moving sluggishly under the pressure of the lard covering their brain from the time they were in power . 
they didn't incur major losses by leaving their offices , we could even consider most of them well - off , so an obvious laziness and a certain coziness can be seen in all their reactions . 
this type of conduct is more serious than we could imagine . 
the opposition neither puts any pressure on the executive , nor warns the electorate nor revives the civil society . 
the ruling party does what it pleases and nobody pokes his nose in to its business . 
actually there is nobody to do it ! 
the Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) gets a slice of the cake while the light is off whereas the others eat their takeaway lunch . 
it is not the motion that seems essential to me . 
it won't pass anyway . 
this resigned attitude of the micro - opposition in parliament throws the political stage out of balance . 
instead of making such moves compromised from the start , the two parties should go back to the springs of reality . 
there are the truths which they should try to bring in to the spotlight . 
there is the source of their power . 
and this should put them in motion to start their fight . 
the numbers of MPs in parliament of both the Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) and the opposition are about the same as in ' 92 - 93 ' ! 
but at that time the opposition was fiercely struggling to get in the limelight . 
and now they are snoring with so much well - being .
