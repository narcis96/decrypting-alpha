Mugur Isarescu is showing to be such a shrewd politician , managing to neither defy those who put him in the premier 's chair nor to allow them to play him a long . 
this implies displaying an adroitness typical of politicians . 
Mugur Isarescu has played unexpectedly well , safe , calm , he has been playing the waiting game , he has been figure skating dodging tight spots . 
he hasn't upset Emil Constantinescu , nor has he stood up to the Liberals or hooked up with the Christian - Democrats . 
he has led them all a long , now with ambiguities and hopes , now with disappointments and expectations , without having said a determined and painful " no " to any of the sides . 
at the same , premier Mugur Isarescu on Wednesday expressed his willingness to run for president , but only as a non - party candidate and providing that " a significant number of citizens express such a will " . 
( obviously , it is about at least 300,000 qualified voters , though Mugur Isarescu didn't give to understand that the minimum number of signatures required for his candidacy submission to be accepted does mean " a significant number " ) . 
Mugur Isarescu 's option proves to be a very well - thought one . 
by specifically saying that he will only be running as a non - party presidential candidate , he makes a highly fair move . 
he thus prejudices none of the parties that supported him for premiership , while also sticking to his commitment to all the political forces that have backed him . 
had he announced his consent to running for president on the slate of some or other partner in the coalition , he would have been suspected of no longer being unbiased . 
had he taken any offer to run for president ( from the Liberals , for instance ) , he would have run the risks of even being ousted as cabinet head . 
moreover , by declaring that he had turned down such an offer from the Liberals and by saying he will always remain a non - party person , Mugur Isarescu also answered the PNTCD Christian - Democrats who were anxiously waiting for a sign . 
in an extremely elegant and polite manner , he turned down their propositions , leaving both the PNTCD and the UFD Rightist Forces Union party in a position as difficult as can be . 
in all this subtle game in which some wanted to forcibly win him over , Mugur Isarescu has responded with precise minutely weighed political moves . 
in my opinion the premier has hardened , he has acquired negotiating skills in a very short while , that is he has grown in half a year as much as it takes other to grow in four years . 
and when you think we only expected Mugur Isarescu to be a times - of - distress premier ! 
so here is another sign that Romania , almost all of a sudden , has gained a politician . 
what will happen next ? 
will that " significant number of citizens " be attained to support him for his presidential candidacy ? 
is president Emil Constantinescu so convincing in the eyes of the civil society as to spur and goad them in to action to get organized and talk Mugur Isarescu in to it ? 
are the Christian - Democrats so lucid as to join such a move at some point ? 
it is hard to tell ! 
it would mean to turn this column in to a fortune - telling one . 
what will happen if the PNTCD , peeved about the premier 's refusal , should launch another candidate ? 
will there be enough resources for the " significant number of citizens " to be attained and propel Mugur Isarescu ? 
or can it be that the premier neither believes nor hopes for it , but has simply been dodging a trenchant answer , waiting to see how political games will be developing ? 
cannot it be that this elegant manner of avoiding to be cornered is the proof of a deeper interest in premiership from Mugur Isarescu 's part ? 
who can guarantee that the PDSR leader Ion Iliescu won't change his mind and withdraw from the presidential race , with the PDSR under the circumstances likely to back Theodor Stolojan instead , and that a coalition between PDSR number two Adrian Nastase and his PNL counterpart Valeriu Stoica may nominate as their premier choice ... Mugur Isarescu ? 
all in all , Romanian political life these days is full of unknowns , games , of subterranean attempts to win over some names , of utopian alliances , whose lifespan will be of a few hours on paper or tantamount to the time it would take one to have a beer and a juice , and afterwards they will all vanish to make room for new hypotheses and projects . 
out of all this , two men have gained something where esteem from the electorate is concerned , namely Mugur Isarescu and Theodor Stolojan . 
now they are both in search of the significant number of citizens !
