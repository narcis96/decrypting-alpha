two fellow journalists last summer invited me to Bucuresti Hotel to discuss the details of a co - operation deal that was about organizing some holiday programme at the hotel 's open swimming pool . 
i arrived at the scene of our meeting and I met a young busy - body playing the part of an omnipotent boss saying " no problem , man , it 's a done deal " every two words he was uttering . 
" we ' ll do anything just to make them notice us and see we exist ! 
and let me give you some papers . 
" the guy was fighting a war with somebody in the government . 
the same day in the afternoon I went back to the hotel for another event staged by Radio 21 station . 
the same cheeky guy you usually can meet on the streets or in the neighbourhood of wholesale places on the city 's outskirts was giving directions to waiters , handling drinks and chairs and shouting to clients over the tables . 
who 's this ? 
Popescu ! 
and that ? 
Popescu , the former 's brother . 
and that one shouting over there ? 
that 's another guy called Popescu . 
everybody at Bucuresti Hotel is called Popescu ? , I asked . 
they are the Popescu clan , the answer came . 
i thought that was a joke . 
but finally I was explained it was all real . 
one of them is state secretary , the other one runs the hotel , and the third is in charge of advertising at the city hall . 
i don't know the worth of each of these Popescu people . 
they may be future politicians stuff , though in a poor " wrapping " . 
they may be resourceful or skilled managers , but I felt I had to leave the place as soon as possible to avoid being seen in such a company . 
however , there was a gain in my experience . 
i learned about the existence of the Popescu clan in the Christian Democratic Party . 
a while later , " Evenimentul zilei " newspaper reported on an incident one member of the Popescu clan had been involved in . 
it was about a traffic accident with an uninsured car being hit and the papers being faked . 
the file opened in the case was made lost in a police safe , as the man involved was one of the Popescu clan members . 
later on , the newspaper applied for an authorization paper from the city council . 
and then we learned why it took them so long to give us the paper : one of the Popescu clan members opposed the move . 
Dash my buttons ! 
at the time former premier Radu Vasile turned against his party it quickly became clear that Sorin Lepsa and the Popescu clan were strongly backing the premier who seemed welded to the government seat for ever . 
and at the time the cabinet ministers tendered their resignations , Popescu name was mentioned as potential full cabinet minister . 
Dash my buttons , the Popescu clan a gain ? ! 
in time , we found out that Popescu brothers not only had control over the young members of the Christian Democratic Party , but they also exerted a strong influence on the party , the Bucharest city hall and the Bucuresti Hotel that has become sort of a disreputable establishment right in the heart of the capital city . 
and I asked myself what the difference was between Dan Iosif and Bebe Ivanovici , on one hand , and the Popescu clan , on the other hand . 
it 's not funny , but a comparison between Dan Iosif and Popescu at the Bucuresti Hotel shows us the former outclasses the latter . 
you could even say Dan Iosif is a gentleman , though such a thing is hard to accept . 
the Popescu clan concerns me only as long as they are the symbol of a certain mentality and certain weaknesses . 
self - serving flies quickly started to swarm around the Christian Democratic Party , just like it happened with Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) . 
and the first to arrive to the cake - slicing ceremony were the rulers ' relatives , friends , clients and contacts . 
what did the current power do at Bucuresti Hotel ? 
they used Cornel Stegaru , the man formerly used by PDSR . 
they produced a new hat under which they pursued their interests . 
that 's what everything boils down to . 
and other institutions a cross the country face a similar situation . 
the people behind the deals have remained unchanged , just the masters have been replaced and will be whenever needed . 
and masters only change the facade , but preserve the procedures . 
professionalism , skill and reliability don't matter . 
Popescu brothers are the outcome of primitive political thinking reduced to just one sentence , that is " it only has to be one of ours . 
" it doesn't matter that " one of ours " is a moron , or follows in the steps of the former holders of his office , or that the institution is heading for disaster , or that ordinary people fall victims to the impertinence of someone whose only quality is the fact that he has joined the power ranks . 
that 's how all sorts of brothers , brothers - in - law , cousins , nephews , wives , grandparents and friends got to be appointed to decision - making posts . 
Amazed with the resourcefulness of the Popescus or other clans closed to the power , we can only dream of an utopian party whose head becomes prime - minister , while his brother goes on a job conversion course and his unemployed son tries hard to get a job .
