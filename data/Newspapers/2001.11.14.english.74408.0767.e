neither Vlad Tepes , nor any of his successors up to Nicolae Ceausescu imagined that someday the space depicted in " Miorita " ballad - where at some moment hard work was done to build " the bright future of humankind " - would see another historic turn of events and discussions would start about setting up a " Dracula Park " . 
that 's an idea ! 
others set up Disneyland , a place to host the charming animated cartoon characters . 
the journey through the world created by Walt Disney brings joy to children all over the world , entertains them and makes them dream . 
only that people want more than just innocent entertainment . 
people have " evolved " . 
they have discovered the pleasure of going through horrifying experiences . 
there are quite a lot of people who see the fact of striking terror in to somebody , or even in to themselves , as yet another form of entertainment . 
and who could become expert in a horror entertainment park other than the people who has produced Dracula and Nicolae Ceausescu ? ! 
aren't we the descendants of the two ? 
haven't we got the copyright on striking terror in to anybody ? 
why shouldn't we turn this gruesome vocation in to a touristic one , in to an international entertainment ? 
the idea seems crazy to me . 
but since we can't make Swiss clocks , or American movies , or Russian bombers , or German highways , why shouldn't we have some fun with people fond of thrilling experiences , as long as they are asking for it and are willing to pay money to go to a park that gives them the shivers ? 
following the project launched by the tourism minister , a similar one has been produced out of the sleeve . 
the Liberal group in Brasov city too plans to build a park to strike terror in to the countless fans of horror movies . 
obviously , so that they show they are Romanians through and through , the " Park Dracula " in Brasov is fiercely fighting against " Dracula Park " in Sighisoara . 
let 's hope this won't become a horrifying war itself , that is , it won't go so far as to cause the two projects to annihilate each other . 
and we also hope and trust that this sort of parks won't spread throughout Romania from border to border . 
because that would crown all , to produce for export only some licensed suitably adorned puppets called little devils to spread them all over the planet . 
the Liberals say a town in prince Hamlet 's homeland is willing to invest in one of the Dracula projects . 
the Tourism Ministry wants something even weirder than the get - rich - quick Caritas investment scheme . 
it wants the taxpayers to cover the costs of its " Dracula Park " . 
as for me , sceptical and not a big fan of horror movies as I am , I make efforts to picture the French , the Americans and the British rushing like hell to get to one of the two Dracula parks to spend their money on scary experiences ( to the great joy of the Romanian investors and the descendants of the sad Danish prince ) . 
i can already picture them speeding on our country 's highways , driving round and past trucks , tractors , trailers , horses , bicycle riders , cows on their way back home from pasture , short sighted goats and deaf old women to be the first to get to the toys designed to strike terror in visitors . 
i ' m very much afraid investors in these projects will be the first to feel horrified ! 
what I ' m trying to say ( though it sounds like a line from one of Caragiale 's play ) is I don't say this project shouldn't be carried out . 
but if this is planned to be done , then I think we should do it so as not to become everybody 's laughing stock . 
and if we manage that , then undoubtedly " Dracula " entertainment park shouldn't be a pretext for emptying taxpayers ' pockets . 
that would be the most horrifying Romanian operation starting before the inauguration of any park , even if it is " Dracula Park " .
