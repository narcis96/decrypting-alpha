an almost Pavlovian question recurs every afternoon : what 's the news ? 
well , they they defoliated the palms ! 
what palms , man ? 
well - well , brothers , but palms were discussed on last week , as well ! 
boss , these people are loosing it . 
they penalised the workers just because some leaves withered ! 
and you think our readers are crazy about palms ? 
i cannot give an accurate answer , but all the people in my neighbourhood talks about the palms . 
some laugh , some curse , some say they would go to the seaside to see them . 
you should know that I met people who actually like it . 
because thus the Romania seaside looks more like the exotic islands ! 
jokes about palms start circulating in our editorial staff , as well . 
let us , too , put some floppy plants like these in our corridor . 
let 's also give the idea to Basescu . 
and let 's bring some banana trees , as well . 
they should also be planted in Victoriei Plaza ( outside the government building ) because we have already started resembling a banana supplier country . 
stop it , my colleagues . 
we are almost loosing it . 
there were people who died in Vulcan mine . 
why don't we try to find out whether miners are still drinking after going underground . 
why don't we try to find out what 's new about Maria Vlas ? 
do you have any news about Vintu ? 
did anybody go to Pitesti when the government we booed by the former investors at the FNI unit trust ? 
what 's Romania supposed to expect following the meeting in Reykjavik ? 
who can find out how were the elections for the Steaua soccer team board made ? 
didn't you see that ten thousand people took it to the streets in Brasov ? 
do you really care about the palms ? 
the meeting of the editorial staff is over . 
a friend calls me . 
what do you think about the palm thing ? 
what do you mean ? 
well , they die , some guys are penalised and them other palms are imported . 
and thus a few jobs are created , as well . 
an employee assigned for two palms each morning . 
he water them , sprays them and asks them nicely not to die . 
and in the afternoon there is someone else assigned to take care of them . 
he watches them until dawn when the therapist returns . 
a hotel with heating is to be to take the palms in during winter . 
what do you say about that ? 
what can I say ? 
well , don't you see , we may thus develop our imports , raise the number of jobs , put to use the empty spaces during winter , give a topic of debate to the public opinion and also create a touristic attraction on the seaside . 
you can imagine that there will be some tens of thousands of tourists saying let 's go to see Agathon 's palms ! 
i ended my phone conversation . 
i will end up dreaming palms . 
in fact , what 's the story with this plant ? 
it grows in Middle East all over the place . 
like the average willow in our country . 
but here it became a national symbol . 
it 's a peculiarity . 
it 's a way to pretend we are exotic . 
it 's the inferiority complex of the trade union 's seaside as compared to the Mediterranean tourism . 
it 's a sort of a giraffe planted on the Black Sea shore so that the Romanian peasants and the unemployed say " there is no such thing " . 
the Romanian palm is like a democratic rule . 
everybody speaks of it during day while at night they defoliate it . 
it 's the admirable pretext to launch national debates on cheap matters who harm nobody . 
the palm is also the embodiment of the famous urge " Mircea , pretend you 're working ! " , is also a delivered on election promise , and a creative thinking of no use to anybody , and reason for critics and also a subject of jokes . 
each palm on the seaside comprises Romanians ' weaknesses and wit . 
i was already exasperated by the issue of the harmless plants when another friend , a tradesman , calls me and says : - Old friend , I found some import palms ! 
only 380 dollars apiece plus VAT . 
they are much cheaper than those on the seaside and are also winter resistant !
