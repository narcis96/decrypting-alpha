what was going on in Iasi that made the city swarm with so many political figures ? 
rock ' n roll concerts ? 
Firewoks ? 
the display of Orthodox Saint Parascheva 's relics ? 
i apologize for thinking that Romanian politicians rushed to Iasi for some totally different reasons . 
they aren't fond of rock music , they are fed up with fireworks shows and the saint 's relics are far from being on their mind . 
it was political reasons that made the cream of the Romanian political world cynically rush to Iasi to show their faces . 
had half of million people crowded the " Giulesti " Stadium ( though it can't accommodate so many supporters ) no politician would have missed the occasion to show up there . 
if the next Sunday two million people gather around the Babele nature monument in Bucegi Mountains , all the leading boards of the political parties , the Senate , the Chamber of Deputies , as well as every member of the cabinet will go there to show their love for the famous geological relics in the Carpathians Mountains . 
you may wonder why they went to Iasi . 
could it be because they all are believers ? 
first of all , belief in God is the most intimate feeling a human being can experience and it 's linked to everybody 's inner self . 
this bond is only intermediated by the church . 
from time to time , people will go to church to pray in silence and without turning this gesture in to a show . 
people will do that discreetly in a church , after which they will resume their daily tasks . 
had things stood this way with politicans , then sometimes somewhere in some church we would have seen some Romanian politician praying in solitude and then crossing himself as he left the church with his mind at peace . 
but so far we haven't heard of such a thing happening . 
Romanian politicians are fond of circus - like shows . 
they will see the Christmas or Easter church services as some political or campaign shows . 
they are very particular about showing themselves to the nation , giving the impression that they are there for people , that they suffer a long with people , that they love and serve the nation . 
all we have to deal with here is infinite hypocrisy . 
and if they went to Iasi , why did the whole cabinet have to stay in line before Saint Parascheva 's relics ? 
after all , it wasn't a job report or a sworn in ceremony . 
and what was justice minister Valeriu Stoica 's business in Iasi ? 
to ask forgiveness for wrong court sentences or for drawn out trials in the chilly court rooms ? 
and what international treaty was Petre Roman supposed to negotiate before Saint Parascheva 's relics ? 
not to mention prime minister Mugur Isarescu who wasn't sure whether he was on a campaign tour or inaugurating some bridge in the neighbourhood giving him a pretext to parade rubbing shoulders with the masses before the TV cameras . 
Ion Iliescu too abandoned himself to this " Vasile monk " mania . 
he prepared his political pilgrimage in a newspaper page full of lies in the hope the masses in Iasi wouldn't see him as an atheist , but as an ardent believer . 
I wouldn't want anybody to understand that the deep contempt I felt seeing all his phony display of politicians has anything to do with the crowd present in Iasi to attend Saint Parascheva 's day celebration . 
god forbid ! 
i would only like people to understand that their beautiful gesture of going to the Moldavian capital city to pray before the saint 's relics was cynically exploited by the political class . 
the politicians 's behaviour over the last years shows us they don't care about people 's suffering . 
they have no clear idea of what they should do to get the country out of the crisis they brought her to . 
all they learned during the ten years of democratic exercise was that they had to behave nicely , to show on TV , and to make promises . 
with a little bit of effort , with a well set alarm clock and a handful of fodder any smart countryside farmer would have taught even a flock of geese to do the same thing . 
and suppose in the evening he put the fodder near a TV set , the geese would surely rush there too . 
allowing Romanian politicians to turn religious celebrations in to some festivals dedicated to their celebrity is equal to allowing them to go far beyond the boundaries of common sense . 
given their minds , they would be able to go as far as to turn even funeral ceremonies in to disgraceful parades . 
to cut it short , Romanian politicians should keep a low profile considering what they ' ve been doing to us . 
their intrusiveness and their pretence of believers can only sicken us to death .
