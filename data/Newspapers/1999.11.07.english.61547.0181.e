it isn't hard to imagine the way some European officials reacted when they heard about the hubbub stirred in Romania by Guenther Verheugen 's letter . 
the news must have stunned them making them look like stone statues holding a file in hands , or sipping from a cup of coffee or steering the car to take the turning . 
it probably was for the first time that these serious people , familiar with all standards of political behaviour , were faced with an answer that struck them dumbfounded . 
they didn't even dare to laugh , as diplomacy forbids mocking at somebody 's blunder . 
European officials won't play games , do foolish things and overstep proper limits . 
and even when they put spokes in your wheel they will do it in an elegant and gentle manner . 
their centuries long style of life and way of behaving do not allow them to cross the line of good manners or to play cheap tricks . 
these people are being now put to an unprecedented test . 
they have to communicate with some other people who don't give a damn about international standards and conventions , let alone their own interests . 
European officials will usually take a seat at the table and engage right a way in diplomatic courtesy giving the impression they have been accustomed to these elegant manners ever since they were cradle babies . 
" i look forward to meeting you when I visit Romania . 
i want to demonstrate how important your country is in the enlargement process . 
my intention is to support you as much as I can . 
" well , don't you feel like squaring your shoulders and throw out your chest ? 
it 's like some invisible wind starts to fill a way your sails . 
you are tempted to imagine that the European Union high official has no idea of the troubles we 're going through . 
that he knows nothing about our economy , poverty or the political bickering . 
when reading the beginning of the letter you are inclined to say the European Union would really be unhappy without our country . 
and when he formulates harsh conclusions on the situation in Romania , speaking about the main measures that should be taken , Verheugen sticks to his gentleman style making suggestions as to the directions Romania should concentrate its efforts on to put economy back on track . 
and he mentions the directions we ' ve heard of for so many years but a long which we haven't been able to make significant headway . 
which is why in the same polite and disarming diplomatic style Verheugen writes that it is desirable that the strategy be worked out in close cooperation with the European Commission and the international financial institutions . 
he could very well use a different wording . 
but it would have been beneath his dignity and the institution 's standards , which I think didn't prevent him from thinking well , guys , so much for the slapdash work you put forward as governing programmes and restructuring plans . 
you have misled us with your originality and strategy you failed to stick to . 
from now on you 're going to work them out with our people and we ' ll check up on your work . 
and if you fail to comply with the decisions to be made you ' ll see no dollars from us . 
but Guenther Verheugen didn't use that kind of words , though they might have woken us up . 
he elegantly wrote about what we were supposed to do , repeatedly stressing the role of Romanian government and experts . 
displaying the same gentleness , Guenther Verheugen removed a lint from our jacket by saying that it would be ideal for us to find a way to involve the main opposition forces in the process of working out a strategy , which would make the latter enjoy solid support . 
but the extremely elegant message of the European Commission , expressed through an etiquette - observing letter , has generated in Romania a low - down show . 
the message failed to be understood , it was disputed by some who didn't even know what the letter was about , and the media trumpets sent out desperate sounds . 
instead of debates , the response to the message was some yap with ludicrous accents and grotesque outbursts . 
which really struck the Europeans dumb . 
just fancy , the thirsty bunny voices his disagreement to the fresh rules regulating the distribution of water whose source is not on its territory . 
consequently , using the same serious wording , the European Union showed the first sign that it might lose its temper . 
a few days ago , we learned from a spokesman that Romania may do whatever she wants , but she shouldn't forget she needs money to make her wishes come true . 
in other words , hey guys , you can go to Mars or to Africa if that 's what you want . 
you are completely nuts ! 
you want money so that you can mock at us ? 
no way ! 
from now on you either stick to the rules or you ' ll have to do for yourselves . 
you won't get any money from us unless you change your attitude . 
Romania may do whatever she wants , but she shouldn't forget she needs money is the first sign of the international community 's irritation with the Romanian political class ' inability to act in a coherent manner .
