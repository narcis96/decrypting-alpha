her Chinese - made radio is always on . 
as the battery slot cover broke , she placed a rubber band around the device . 
" now live from the Meteorology Institute , good morning , . " 
when she hears this weather woman she gets scared ! 
yesterday she was speaking as if reading the " Danube water levels " everyday report . 
she was talking about the heat wave as if she was counting small change . 
on Tuesday night , when the furnace overflowed above the city , she felt like cursing the weather woman . 
why didn't you tell me to run a way ? 
i ' d have gotten to the pond or hidden in the woods ! 
for two hours I felt my skin melting ! 
and it 's right when these people 's bowels had to start rumbling ! 
missis Mia sells hot - dogs nearby Bucharest 's Gara de Nord rail station . 
she has a stand under lease from a man living in the Giulesti district who is a way picking oranges in Greece . 
yesterday morning she brought a long three one - liter bottles with water from the drinking fountain . 
she wrapped them up in some rags and hid them in a corner of the stand . 
around ten she had only one bottle left , and the water was already foul . 
and she still hadn't quenched her thirst , as she oozed out all the water she drank . 
around noon she thought of pulling down the shutters . 
a cashier with one of the Turkish coach bus travel agencies came over and said she found out from the Turks that cold water will kill you in hot weather . 
it is much smarter to drink hot tea , and the Turks must know what they 're doing , as they live in the desert . 
missis Mia can only picture the Turks in their tents , building a fire on two rocks and rubbing the coffee pot against the sand heated in a pan . 
so convinced that Turkey is all a desert scorched by the sun she obeys the cashier and sends a kid to buy three tea sachets . 
she gets a tin cup and takes some of the water in which the hot dogs are boiling , then she dips the sachet in the hot water and rubs her hands in content . 
starting from the millenniums - old experience of the Turks in the desert , she will quench her thirst not far a way from the Gara de Nord walls . 
with no sugar in it , the tea is tasteless . 
she looks to the station . 
there is no stray dog in sight . 
now it 's a good time to catch them , missis Mia thinks , the most dignified snack stand vendor in the rail station area . 
the Gypsy flower girls give up , and around noon they pack up and close their stands . 
a newspaper vendor packs up and leaves , too , saying " Man , the papers will catch fire and I ' ll have to pay for them " . 
it 's better for him to take the papers back than to let them catch fire , she thinks . 
once in a while a farmer who came to sell vegetables in the Matache marketplace will stop at the stand . 
he sold everything so he walks around until his four o ' clock train . 
still alive , ma ' m ? 
we are all dying ! 
she allows him to take a sip of the warm tea . 
awful heat ! 
it ain't no water melons , the tomatoes ' ve shrivelled up , the green peppers , too . 
every day I ' ve watered them until there was only mud left in the well ! 
now let God water them , I said to myself as it 's either the end of the world , or vegetables will grow next year ! 
a Moldavian man stops before the stand smelling of water mixed with hot dog grease . 
he has a black hat on , and the sweat drops in his mouth as he looks up to the sky . 
" even the fields caught fire where we live ! 
" oh my , aunt Mia says looking for a sausage hidden somewhere in the steel basin . 
" hey , ma ' m , didn't they install air condition in here for you ? 
" missis Mia feels her feet wet in the slippers , the sore armpits , the sweat all over her face . 
it seems like the sweat was dripping even through the ears and her hearing is getting poorer . 
who is supposed to install it for her ? 
who is supposed to give her cold mineral water ? 
serve you right , she says to herself , if you didn't like learning and wouldn't run a way with that Italian who asked you to marry him on the day of the first high school finishing exam ! 
you got no diploma , foreign citizenship or wealth ! 
i get heated up and face hot weather better , she answers the man . 
and her eyes look on the foot prints left in the asphalt by the Moldavian who wouldn't but anything . 
he went to the soft drinks stand and he empties two small - sized Fantas straight in to his belly . 
damn skinflints , she says to herself , you grind your teeth for each thousand lei ! 
and the trolley buses are all swelled up like garbage cans . 
as they pass by she think they reek of diesel oil . 
and the waste is boiling . 
just the floozy at the exchange office is not suffering . 
she can see the water drops dripping down the glasses which are cold like ice blocks . 
some guy in a foreign make of car stopped in front of her . 
he keeps the car windows shut like a boyar hiding in the back cool room . 
he is counting money . 
missis Mia closes her eyes to no longer see the sausages assailed by flies , the greasy water boiling with large smelly bubbles . 
if only she had run a way with the Italian . And that lout with his money counting ! 
he and the woman at the counter eye up each other , he has the head tilted to hold the cell phone against his shoulder , talking and handling money so smoothly as if he was some of the offenders impersonating cops to get fine money from foreigners . 
missis Mia , the most reasonable snack stand vendor around the Gara de Nord , sees red before her eyes , gets out of her booth , takes the slipper off her right foot and hurls it against the wind screen . 
she hits a gain and a gain , and the cheap slipper bounces off just like a ball on the asphalt until it rebounds between her eyes , and the woman starts weeping . 
she is sobbing and shaking , as if choked with her own sweat . 
a client standing before the counter stares at her and says : " What do you know , it 's forty degrees plus !
