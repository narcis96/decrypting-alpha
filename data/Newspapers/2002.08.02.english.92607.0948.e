i ' m trying to picture a discussion among cabinet ministers with Vasile Dancu as protagonist . 
as he has the advantage of being the author of some books on communication ( in their turn written from other books ) , he appears as a guru in this field of activity . 
unlike the other cabinet ministers and state secretaries who get horrified whenever they have to meet the press , Dancu always has a theoretical explanation at hand , he always comes up with a meaning and even with a strategy . 
summer is cunningly deceptive , both at political and communication level . 
the government 's enemy never sleeps ! 
awful blows could be struck ! 
the adversaries could fill the media space where since last autumn the ruling power has nested like a brood hen . 
so , summer isn't summer , but the right season for enemies and the ruling power has to tighten vigilance . 
because of the state of idleness that sets in , this is the perfect time to launch unsettling rumours , messages and strategies . 
Dancu says summer is an auspicious time for " entertainment news , extra - political passions , syntheses ( you ' ve blown it this time , Gogule ! ) , the deviant actuality ( a concept matching Aristotle 's abstract ideas ) and the conflicts between top public figures " . 
i suppose you can picture the ministers ' face expression when they learn that summer is right for " syntheses and deviant actuality " . 
it makes their heads spin . 
skilfully presented on computer or by use of sketches , Dancu 's theories leave them dumbfounded and lost in a rosy haze . 
they feel smarter , safer , but they don't know what way to go . 
just picture a cabinet minister telling his press officers hey guys , this is a serious matter . 
this summer 's more dangerous than the rest . 
you have to " picket media sources " and " resort to selective activism " . 
and what do the guys with the mass media department do ? 
hey boss , should we watch them , spy them or go have a beer with the journalists ? 
you picket them , you morons , and do selective activism ! 
what 's that supposed to be , boss ? 
you ingratiate yourselves with the smartest of them . 
and how do we make " counter - theme press files to counteract the press favourite attacks during vacation time against the infrastructure in tourism and   transportation sectors , comfort , food industry , public order , camps , prices , incomes " ? 
you have my word , guys , that 's what Dancu 's strategy says . 
just picture the members of the government , ladies and gentlemen , scratching their ears and trying hard to explain the matter to spokespersons and press officers . 
counter - theme to the infrastructure in the tourism sector ? 
should we mention Dracula Park or not ? 
or should we present them the successes scored in the agrotourism sector and give them the figure of foreign tourists who got the hot maize porridge glued to the beam ? 
and what should we say about prices ? 
that we ' ll talk in the fall or that they dropped yesterday but the government didn't get to make the announcement as they went on vacation ? 
you know what the vacation rituals are ? 
you 're so uneducated ! 
your ministries should send you attend some refresher course to learn it 's " discos , trips , shopping " . 
and then , keep in mind that if a ministry manages to get a celebrity involved to support its cause it will surely be successful . 
so , all ministries should turn to singers . 
for instance , call Adrian Copilu ' Minune to attend the inauguration ceremony of a dam or some hydro power plant . 
and Vadim - the inauguration of a sewage system in Cucuietii din Deal hamlet . 
if the " Tribune " is a way to oxygenate his brains , settle for a mayor fond of some booze . 
" the mayor or any other city councilor can increase your influence " . 
Dancu fantasizes in a precious language and the government members are gaping at the academic rattle , even though it 's of no use to them . 
as for Romanians ' problems , the hell with them ! 
it 's the image that counts . 
the rest can wait .
