though he is a dislikeable person and his look is just opposite to that of a star , interior minister Dudu Ionescu hadn't had much trouble with the press . 
quite the contrary , I would say . 
he 's got good press for the way he started his job , dispersed the miners riots in Stoenesti and for the beginning of the police reform process . 
neither his fellow colleagues , nor politicians interfered with the steps he had taken and the press even saluted some of his firm decisions . 
that 's why his proposal to tighten punishments enforced on journalists has come as a surprise . 
but as there is no smoke without fire , something must have caused the interior minister to take such an initiative . 
so , what would it be about ? 
is there possible that he was presented some statistics data provided by a mathematician policeman who had calculated by moving beads on a counting frame that the number of " law breakers infiltrated in to mass - media " was the main cause of the crime rate on the rise ? 
it 's possible ! 
but no matter how many beads the policeman had incorrectly moved , the minister couldn't possibly see the fact that the real trouble makers were not at all the people armed with ball pens and microphones . 
can it be that the colonels and generals that had got bad press told their boss please take these press law breakers off our backs , cause they are such a pain in the neck ! 
we can't take bribe , or keep a woman , or make some money from smuggling any longer cause they are watching us . 
but though it is possible that some superior officers had thought this way , I don't think they would have had the guts to tell their boss such a thing as they were running the risk to meet with a blunt dismissal and be assigned to street patrol . 
but in this case where could Dudu Ionescu 's bright idea come from ? 
can not it be that a little bird told him what to do ? 
that it was joyfully flying and then it landed on a neuron branch of our minister and whispered him Sir , you 're a dead man if you don't strike terror in to those journalists . 
did you see what they did to you when the street gangs riots in Brasov turned violent ? 
they jumped down your throat and mocked at you because you were not able to quell the hooligans ' riots . 
these press law breakers will disclose corrupt policemen , the affairs covered up by high ranking officers , and the villain things going on in the Christian Democratic Party . 
you won't be able to reduce them to silence . 
and there 's no way to leave them without stories , as you can't stop crimes , smuggling operations and dirty business arrangements . 
so the only way you can claim the situation has seen an improvement is to strike terror in these beastly journalists . 
and the little bird must have whispered a gain that increased punishments would be of use in the forthcoming election campaign and quiet and sullen as Dudu Ionescu is , he still rushed to see the Christian Democrats and the Liberals and told them guys , I ' ve got an idea how to strike terror in to journalists and show voters how effectual we are . 
we ' ll simply tighten punishments for libel . 
the Council of Europe said we should diminish them , so what ? ! 
what do they know ? 
Romania is a horse of another colour . 
and now it 's in our yard . 
and both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals said well done , Dudu , throw them in jail ! 
didn't the journalists say they were after the truckful of information disclosed to the former political police Securitate by Mircea Ionescu Quintus ? 
didn't the honorable dozer politician sign a bill on journalists ' professional accreditation ? 
don't Christian Democrats too want to reduce bad pressmen to silence ? 
let them spend some time in prison , see how life is there and then come and stir the waters ! 
that 's how Dudu Ionescu 's proposal popped up . 
he was the one to propose it , but the idea comes from somewhere else . 
from the coalition 's subconscious . 
had the interior minister sincerely been concerned about the improvement of legislation on freedom of speech he would have taken the first democratic step on the matter , that is he would have proposed the journalists community a project and would have triggered debates on the issue . 
but he did nothing of the kind . The Christian Democratic minister who has honorably performed his duty so far , though his job calls for enforcing measures to boost individual safety , speaks about transparency but strives to tighten punishments on the sly . 
something tells me that there is a close connection between the bill tabled by three senators and Dudu Ionescu 's proposal . 
somewhere behind the scene , where strategies are being negotiated on , it was decided that the press should be reduced to silence . 
we can't wage the election campaign , can't make money , can't do anything . 
we ' ll tell people that we are after thieves , and nobody will realize that it is the journalists we are planning to bust .
