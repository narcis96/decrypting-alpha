the thought that things could but get better now that the PDSR won the elections struck even cats on the roofs . 
not to mention what voters thought , as they were bombarded with promises too great though compared to what the PDSR needed to make it back to power . 
and the raise in the Greater Romania Party 's ratings acted as sort of a shield against extremism , so that Iliescu was voted by people you less expected to do that . 
and what has come out of it ? 
the PDSR government , looking a little bit better than the previous one , but now finding itself turning on a spit between the international bodies and the demands put forward by loss - making industrial chunks such as SIDEX and SIDERCA iron and steel mills , TAROM national airline , ROMAN truck maker and many others . 
where should the government get money from to meet all these demands ? 
average people ponder over the matter too , trying to understand what 's happening . 
where should we get money from as long as God himself gives us no penny ? 
Romanians may be desperate , but they are not dumb and unable to understand what 's going on . 
and they curse , clench their teeth , make some money from time to time , but they survive and say O . K , that 's it ! , they have no money ! 
but let 's hope at least they are smarter than their predecessors and not on the take as they or their successors were before . 
let 's hope we can at least see the law observed , and some order enforced and tarnished people put aside . 
it 's sure wheat won't grow overnight and factories won't start spitting hand - out salami in less than no time . 
but the new rulers should show some character . 
this is pretty much what that change for the better we all had in mind boils down to . 
and I think this is the point where the PDSR starts screwing things up . 
there are too many indications that many compromised people under suspicion of having done wrong or under investigations are being reappointed to important offices overnight . 
in central institutions , customs department , police and all sorts of local bodies . 
they are being brought back as if they were clean , new or revamped . 
we may be a cheerful nation , often absent - minded and passionate , but our memory doesn't fail us . 
didn't papers report on all these men ? 
so what ? ! 
they are all the black sheep of their communities . 
and their comeback to important offices is nothing but an insult to the people who voted for the PDSR . 
which is why in small locales , in towns and cities , as well as in Bucharest , the " dowry " of hope and support for the PDSR is getting smaller with every new " dalmatian " restored to some high office . 
only that this time the operation is unfolding rapidly with no waste of time . 
if during their former term of office they needed time to figure out individuals , now , when we know what label each of them carry , the credibility loss occurs on the very day of their decision - making . 
a question still needs to be asked . 
is Adrian Nastase facing a shortage of reserve staff or has he lost control of the process of gaining back political institutions ? 
and there 's another bitter pill . 
maybe many will have no trouble swallowing it , but they can't take us all for suckers . 
the successive closing of some criminal investigation files is as risky as the political clientele restoration . 
it looks like the fresh police and prosecution heads are " treating with smoke " all the files opened by their predecessors . 
they didn't do , didn't steal , didn't assault , didn't forge , didn't cheat ! 
they were pure angels and political victims . 
that is , the time from 1996 till 2000 was about mere witch hunting and no justice . 
could it really be so ? 
is it out of the question that Miron Cozma will be released from jail and decorated ? 
is it out of the question that PDSR treasurer Gheorghe Pascu will become sort of a honorary chevalier of God knows what order ? 
is it out of the question that Radu Timofte has turned smart overnight and Ristea Priboi has turned a dissident ? 
is is out of the question that , because nobody in the parliament or the mass media attempts to speak openly , Ion Iliescu , Adrian Nastase and the PDSR are inclined to think things can work anyway ? 
An easy - going politics seems to be the characteristic of the current power and this is a dangerous trend . 
their credibility may rapidly erode and very rapidly too will the poor made their grumbling heard . 
and what will we do then , as we have no other country to emigrate to , or other party to turn to , or European support ? ! 
though I figured the economic problems wouldn't be easy to fix , I would dismiss the idea that the PDSR would face threats because of its shortage of staff , much thinner than promised by the party . 
at the risk of stirring scornful reactions , I ' m afraid in some months from now on the PDSR will see its popularity ratings rapidly sagging to the levels late 1995 and early 1996 .
