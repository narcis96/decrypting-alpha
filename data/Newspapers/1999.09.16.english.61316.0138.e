the plane accident the other day when Greece 's alternate foreign minister lost his life brought in to the spotlight an institution which hadn't long been the focus of attention , namely the Prosecutor 's Office ! 
as the prosecutors team arrived late on the Otopeni airport , transport minister Traian Basescu highlighted the delay , while premier Radu Vasile , known for promptly voicing his opinion , announced measures will be taken . 
the premier 's discontent and the negative impact caused by the slowness of the Prosecutor 's Office prompted the first self - defence reaction . 
the Bureau for relations with the media hurried to release a two - page communique and an additional communique trying to show their hands are clean and to convince us they were innocent and even quick . 
in order to understand how things stand , we should carefully read the texts in question . 
the Prosecutor 's Office claim to have been contacted at 11:30 p.m.. 
according to France Presse news agency , the Greek plane landed at Otopeni at 10:33 p.m. , and it was known in advance there were problems with the aircraft . 
two representatives of the airport authorities say they notified the Transports department of the police at 11:00 p.m. 
so there are 27 minutes during which no policeman at Otopeni , irrespective of the structure he belonged to , notified his superiors . 
let 's admit that , despite the delay , the police Transports department learnt the news , namely that there was a " plane with problems and dead passengers " . 
what did the police transports policeman do for 30 minutes ? 
did he try to get in touch with his minister ? 
did he try to get in touch with his boss ? 
did he call his wife ? 
there is a police rule : in case of dead people , the prosecutor shall be immediately notified . 
so there is clearly a half an hour wasted . 
cannot it be that the transports police notified quickly the Prosecutor 's Office which , having the bad luck of having a beginner prosecutor on duty , wasted some time ? 
the communique says that the Prosecutor 's Office was notified at 11:30 p.m. and that " beginning with 11:30 p.m. , the two prosecutors were picked up from their domicile and driven by the Dacia office car " . 
supposing we were blind or with a short memory that makes it impossible for us to remember what is written a few lines above , we still cannot find it plausible that the prosecutor on duty be notified and the other two prosecutors be picked up from their domicile at the same time , at 11:30 p.m. 
this is far - fetched . 
the notification call must have taken one or two minutes . 
the prosecutor hung up , called the driver , who wasn't there by his side , and sent him to pick up the two prosecutors from home . 
or he first called the two , woke them up , explained them the situation , told them he was sending the car . 
this would take another five minutes ! 
then the driver left and picked them up from home , probably after midnight . 
therefore there are in the communique inadvertences which in an ordinary investigation case may cause an innocent to be arrested or a criminal to get a way . 
the funny thing about the communique is that the poor prosecutors were driven on a Dacia car and that is why they started work so late . 
i don't mean to imply this goes for all the Prosecutor 's Office employees . 
there are enough young people whose living standard is modest , but I haven't seen too many of the old employees driving a Trabant or a Dacia , or living like the needy in the sorry suburbia of Bucharest . 
i analysed the implausible hours mentioned in the Prosecutor 's Office release not only because they don't look credible to me , but also because behind them an institution hides which is never to be blamed , never wrong , never held responsible , an institution where files were buried and decisions on files - rigged . 
let us not forget that the big corruption games and the political interference with justice occurred on the domain of this institution , too . 
and now , in a crisis situation when the Prosecutor 's Office was slow , instead of looking in to the causes of the delay and eventually admit it , the employees with the Bureau for relations with the media are trying to sell their side of the story , aimed at reassuring everybody . 
i can smell a rat in these persistent attempts to exculpate themselves which conceal more than a mere reasoning error or a mistaken time . 
suppose a traffic accident happens in which ten people die , it 's a rainy night and a lorry with a foreign plate caused the accident . 
suppose the prosecutor arrives there at past 11:30 p.m. sharp , when the dead are already at the hospital , marks - washed a way by the rain , witnesses - gone and the truth - lost amid thousands of hypotheses . 
so much for starting court procedures and justice being served !
