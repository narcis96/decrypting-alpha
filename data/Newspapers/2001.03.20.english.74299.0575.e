i would like to quote from what Corneliu Vadim Tudor , the leader of the Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) , said : " The Greater Romania Party ends a week during which it fully proved that it makes a constructive opposition serving the national interest . 
it 's mostly about the favourable vote that our parliamentarians gave to the state secret law and the Law on foreigners ' regime . 
" so the disputed law passed with the help of the " constructive opposition " made by the Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) . 
it would have been a big surprise that the former Securitate officers who joined the PRM should oppose a bill referring to the careful protection of the state secret . 
didn't they try so hard to protect our secret of producing stainless steel spoons , our recipe to make watered - down lemonade , the secret to make the brakes of the old Dacia car , the formula of making waterproof material , etc. ? 
patriots and Europeans , Vadim 's supporters even voted enthusiastically , proud that their former colleagues who remained in the Romanian Intelligence Service ( SRI ) will finally have work to do . 
i don't want anyone to understand that the law on classified information ( the state secret law ) would be useless , all the more since a long the years those who have disclosed classified information were neither journalists , nor teachers , nor doctors nor farmers . 
the most disturbing and shocking information was made public by officers or former officers of the Romanian secret services . 
the adopted , but so much disputed , law comforts the civil servants and the officers , and tries to turn all the Romanian citizens in to guards to protect the work of a small group of civil servants and officers who do what they please anyway . 
but I did not quote Vadim Tudor because of the law . 
the syntagm " constructive opposition " , correlated with Adrian Nastase 's attack against the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) ( which first agreed to voting in favour of the law and then did quite the opposite ) , is very interesting . 
what I mean is that the ruling Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) starts to no longer need the Liberals , but it can count on full support of the Greater Romania Party ( PRM ) . 
and from what I have heard that is going on inside the parliamentary commissions , a real PDSR - PRM voting machine works every time they raise their hands . 
as a matter of fact , since the new legislative assembly started working , the Greater Romania Party has only had one dispute with the PDSR , concerning the local public administration law . 
a part from that , there has been a convenient silence , a discreet fraternity , and a peaceful cooperation between them . 
have you heard ever a gain in parliament or at a press conference the slogan " Down with the mafia " ? 
have you noticed any opposing move ? 
when the bills are put to vote , the parliamentarians of the Greater Romania Party act like the Calarasi or Tulcea locals of the PDSR . 
the risk posed by such an attitude , despite offering PDSR a certain comfort in parliament , seems huge to me . 
the sworn fraternity between the two parties will eventually put PNL in its place and so the opposition will account for only 15 percent of parliament , which is almost nothing . 
at the same time it won't be long until the West will notice the PRM 's " constructive opposition " . 
after another two or three statements like the above - quoted one , the European countries will realize that the parties " with the same blood group " have a strong cooperation despite the fact that immediately after the November elections the PDSR leaders said this " option " was out of the question . 
and when the Westerners will understand the whole thing , it will be useless for Viorel Hrebenciuc to go to Corneliu Vadim Tudor and say , come on , Cornel , curse and swear at us a little bit ! 
the West will notice PDSR 's duplicity and won't take it as a theatrical performance . 
they will treat us accordingly . 
Ion Iliescu will then pay working visits only to the towns of Oltenita , Focsani , Brasov , and Ploiesti , will attend book releases and will receive some second - rate foreign politicians , and nothing else , whereas Adrian Nastase will try hard to shake the piggy bank hoping some foreigner will put a few coins in to it . 
the " constructive opposition " of the Greater Romania Party can bring us to sheer poverty .
