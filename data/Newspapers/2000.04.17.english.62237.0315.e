" i don't care " seems to have been one of the sentences most frequently uttered by Romanians . 
i don't care about the rulers ' blunders , I don't care about my neighbour , I don't care about the factories going bankrupt . 
i really believed that " I don't care " is a form of resignation , selfishness and contempt . 
but the campaign launched by the private television PRO TV is commendable for having shattered a prejudice and an inertia . 
in their typical manner , with all the due fuss , our colleagues with PRO TV launched an extraordinary move , aimed at arousing human solidarity and at summoning up the Romanians ' civic reflexes . 
judging by what could be seen yesterday and the other day , the outcome is impressive . 
Romanians are not an inert nation ! 
not even the Socialist years have managed to annihilate their civic sense . 
the average people 's response to the appeal launched by both PRO TV and the public television TVR is praiseworthy . 
and we should not see this as mere Christian generosity . 
of course the devastating effects of floods struck a chord with the people . 
but the overwhelming response includes a complex lesson , which should not be seen just as loving thy neighbour . 
if we think of the Romanians ' behaviour in December 1989 , when children and elderly people , blue collar workers and intellectuals came together at the first breeze of freedom , then we can tie today 's solidarity reaction to a relatively recent past . 
back then , too , needy people would come by to bring food to the soldiers or to the revolutionary children . 
back then , too , people who did not know each other would come together and stick together . 
the dangers , huge as they may have been , turned out to be too small to leave room for selfishness and self - preservation . 
this can make us think that , big as the evil made by the decades of Communist rule may have been , the people 's nature was not altered . 
or , supposing that those years have someway affected our nature , there are still resources allowing that mystery which unites us all in to a nation to be rekindled . 
what else are we to infer from the commendable PRO TV initiative ? 
that whenever a television or a radio station or a newspaper launches a public interest campaign with positive connotations , chances that it will be a success are as high as can be . 
we cannot help wondering what would have become of such an initiave , had it belonged to some authority or public institution . 
against the background of the people 's feeling sick and tired and discontented , the response is sure not to have been half of what it was . 
the people would have suspected some interests hiding behind the appeal . 
they would have hesitated at the mere thought that somewhere a long the way things will get messed up , as it will happen in almost all institutions . 
they would have even refused to get involved , by adopting this attitude in protest over the authorities . 
the Romanians ' impressive response to the initiative launched following the floods ( and to the PRO TV 's " We care " campaign in particular ) should really set politicians thinking . 
when they complain about not being understood , about not being followed by the community , it means that it is not the community that has a major problem , it means that they don't know how to convince people , that their credibility is low and that whatever they may say will be labelled as political humbug . 
in 1989 there were people who gave their life for democracy . 
others gave money , clothes or food . 
they gave part of their time and energy . 
as this generosity has been used and tarnished , people have come to where they no longer give a damn . 
why ? 
easy , because their confidence has been abused too much , they have been told too many words , they have been too much deceited . 
so not caring is not the Romanians ' fault , but of those who are not able to mobilize them for a good cause to everybody 's benefit . 
the extraordinary way in which the Romanian nation understood to show solidarity with their distressed human fellows can be seen as the first step in reconsidering civic sense . 
that is why " Evenimentul zilei " this week plans to get Bucharesters involved in a cleaning campaign the city is in big need for . 
the PRO TV initiative showed us that this can be done . 
so let 's give them the credit for it ! 
well done , PRO TV !
