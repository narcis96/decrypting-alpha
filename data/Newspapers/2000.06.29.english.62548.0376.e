not long ago I heard someone accusing the government of doing nothing to help Ioan Alexandru , one of the great poets of Romanian literature . 
out of conviction and out of a tremendous desire to see a democratic life starting in Romania , Ioan Alexandru enlisted in the PNTCD Christian - Democratic party . 
he was the one to hang the cross on the the wall behind the presidium in the former seat of the Chamber of Deputies . 
i will not elaborate now on Ioan Alexandru 's wonderful poetry or on his misfortune . 
but despite the tremendous drama he is experiencing , I don't find it appropriate to put the blame for this on the government . 
there are thousands of Romanians - some less prominent , others as famous as this poet - the government should be doing something for . 
actually the executive 's job is not to help out some individuals , but the entire country . 
speaking of Ioan Alexandru 's particular case , it is not the government that should issue an emergency decree , but Romanian intellectuals . 
authors , artists , journalists could very well contribute and help out a peer in big , big distress . 
if we are not able to get together when a peer is in an emergency situation , we won't be able to get together when Romania reaches a crisis situation . 
if Romania 's intelligentsia were to make a single move in support for Ioan Alexandru , then this would surely make the Christian - Democrats blush and react in their turn . 
another great Romanian poet is in an equally distressful situation . 
i mean Geo Dumitrescu , one of the " immortals " in the Academy , a cornerstone of Romanian culture . 
geo Dumitrescu , aged 80 , is one step a way from being thrown in the street at a time when the country should be showing him the deepest gratitude , when he should see special and critic editions of his works published to honour him , when both he and Ioan Alexandru should have statues erected . 
two years ago , Geo Dumitrescu 's house in centre Bucharest was restored to its rightful owner . 
the poet was a gentleman . 
he promised he would move out and allow the owner to be restored his rights . 
and in 1998 he was allotted an apartment he could never occupy . 
furthermore , for one year and a half he paid taxes , and even rent for the bachelor flat on the Nerva Traian street . 
and when he wanted to move in , it was only to see that a revolutionary woman had a metal door installed . 
the person in question had also been allotted another one room flat based on the revolutionary certificate , which she sold . 
geo Dumitrescu filed a complaint with the Bucharest third district police . 
and for six months now the president of Romania 's Academy Eugen Simion , the president of the Writers Union Laurentiu Ulici plus poets Adrian Paunescu and Mircea Dinescu have been pleading with the third district police to see Geo Dumitrescu 's rights restored . 
an work that will fill an entire library cannot override a revolutionary 's paper glued to the a policeman 's brain ! 
and this is how we are living the drama of the powerlessness of Romanian culture , of the Romanian citizens and of the country 's institutions , which are only good at putting spokes in others ' wheel and at squeezing graft money . 
if neither the appeal by the Romanian Academy or by the Writers Union nor the complaint by a prominent man of the city counts , then this country is surely on the brink of going a stray . 
what children learn at school , who the people are who represent Romania in the concert of world culture , all this no longer counts . 
at school pupils will be taught jokes told by moronic lazy policemen , the subjects at the high school finishing exams will be picked from the " works " of quasi - illiterate completely dishonest politicians , and the only thing we will be able to contribute to European libraries will be the ankles of the prostitutes a long the beltway . 
if some policemen don't know what a work means the size of the records at their precinct , maybe there will be somebody higher - ranking somewhere a long the chain of command ( which most often looks like the branches of a tree ) who , having lived from reading books , too , not only from watching TV , will try to set things right as required under the law . 
there is nothing Romanian intellectuals can do for Geo Dumitrescu . 
but the authorities , having managed to make for themselves so many house swap arrangements , could intervene to make sure an illegally occupied house will be evacuated or another home will be allocated . 
if the state institutions can do nothing for Geo Dumitrescu , then it is likely that there will be nothing the Romanian nation in its turn will be able to do for them .
