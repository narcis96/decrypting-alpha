i invite you to try and answer a very simple question . 
does it bother you that gymnast Corina Ungureanu accepted to pose topless for " Playboy " magazine ? 
but give the issue some thought before jumping at a conclusion . 
is it really that bad ? 
hundreds of thousands of women , many of them famous , accepted to pose not only topless , but completely naked and in some very provocative physical attitudes . 
and what happened to them ? 
they enjoyed success and boasted all their life about their achievement . 
which is why many will chase such a chance and feel hurt in their feelings if their offer is turned down . 
others simply won't do it either on prudishness grounds or reasons tied to their religious belief or principles . 
and they would go through a terribly distressing experience if they were secretly taken photographs of . 
it 's about one 's way of thinking , which is an individual matter . 
if we asked people in different places around the world to answer the question in the beginning of my editorial we would see the countries ' nature and history reflected in their answers . 
for instance , an opinion poll conducted in Iran or Pakistan might show that 99 percent of women would definitely turn down such an offer . 
they would even take it as an insult . 
in eastern Europe countries the percentage of women who wouldn't accept being posed may be high too , though lower than in the countries previously mentioned . 
in the USA , things would stay exactly the other way round . 
most young women would be happy to be given such a chance . 
therefore , sitting for such a magazine neither hurts , nor does it cause any damages . 
it depends only on whether a young woman can or cannot show her breasts . 
in the case of a gymnast , it would be a serious thing if she chose to make strip - tease in a sports competition or , as a student in her first year at a high school and world champion in gymnastics , she chose to pose for a porno magazine in Bucharest . 
but Corina Ungureanu didn't pose at school , nor for a porno magazine , she posed for a well - known international magazine . 
on top of it , she is of full age . 
what has in common her exceptional performance at the Gymnastic World Championship in Tianjin with her pictures in " Playboy " ? 
that is what you should keep in mind when trying to answer the question launched in the beginning of this editorial . 
does it bother you that Corina Ungureanu , of Romanian citizenship , of full age and in charge of her private life , accepted to pose naked ? 
it 's not such a big deal if you feel like blaming her move . 
you may do that out of religious reasons , which is quite natural . 
but if there is no underlying reason for blaming her , but you still feel like condemning her lack of prudery , then you have a slight problem . 
you are very much alike the Romanian Gymnastics Federation officials and Nadia Comaneci . 
they too considered the gymnast had acted in breach of the code of ethics set by them , though ethics is the science that studies the moral value of human conduct . 
and Corina Ungureanu couldn't possibly act in breach of that science . 
moreover , public moral sense is one thing , whereas private moral sense can often be full of light and shade . 
what causes surprise is the fact that Corina Ungureanu 's move has also been blamed by a great champion , namely Nadia Comaneci . 
she seems to have forgotten ( or she has really forgotten ) about her appearance in underwear commercials , or other things exclusively related to her private life . 
probably someone thought of asking her opinion on the matter and Nadia thought it would be better for her to take a lady - like stand on the issue , which made her fall victim to preconceived judgments . 
Nadia Comaneci voiced her opinion and we have to respect it . 
it 's hers , whether it is good or questionable . 
what seems to me funny is that the officials on the Romanian Gymnastic Federation , instead of just expressing their pros and cons , which is acceptable both for them and for any other individual , consider that their moral values and opinions are a must when it comes to sports people 's private life , including the life of world champion Corina Ungureanu . 
according to their opinion , the gymnast has the right to bring us world , European or Olympic titles , to serve Romanian sports and her country , but under no circumstances has she the right to pose topless for a magazine . 
the guillotine - like opinion expressed by the Romanian Gymnastic Federation officials doesn't come as a shock . 
they decided to remove Corina 's name from the list of the best - rated gymnasts of the year and that 's it . 
in fact , their way of thinking is in line with that of many Romanian bosses . 
well indoctrinated under Ceausescu 's rule , they think they have the right to rule our private life . 
those of you who instead of answering the question chose to shrug your shoulders or just say " it 's her business " though you were displeased with her move are no boss stuff . 
you only stand high chances of being part of an unlimited and often picturesque normalcy .
