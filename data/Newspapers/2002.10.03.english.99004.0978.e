it really doesn't matter whether a child abuser is a policeman , a teacher , a technician , yellow or of any other colour , a Romanian , German or Italian citizen . 
but whose son is he ? 
what are his parents doing for a living ? 
does he have any siblings ? 
and where did he complete his higher education ? 
as if having completed his education at Harvard or in Timisoara would make one less of a pedophile . 
in a normal , unprejudiced country you are not judged by the colour of your hair , your eyes , or your citizenship . 
you are simply judged by your doings . 
that 's why justice is blind and that 's why we say a country is civilized . 
we , because of the statements made by Ioan Talpes , run the risk of being perceived as a country of artists . 
one steals a plant . 
it doesn't count , because he is one of the ruling party 's men . 
a drunk guy who works for the secret services hits an old lady on the crosswalk and sends her to the other world . 
wait a minute , the mighty will say . 
he 's on the secret services . 
missions got him stressed out . 
now , in Kurt Treptow case , Ioan Talpes behaves like an old auntie . 
and so do the authorities . 
they haven't nabbed the American . 
they are protecting him as if he were a   libellula . 
moreover , Ioan Talpes says the man is both an American citizen and a public figure . 
the presidential adviser set to help the man who 's been his friend since the time they were both working a long with general Ilie Ceausescu is introducing in discussion a sophisticated discrimination . 
as Treptow is an American citizen , we cannot do things by the book . 
we have to be more careful . 
and as he is a scholar , his sexual activity too must have some intellectual connotations . 
i beg your pardon ! 
Ioan Talpes brings up for discussion two elements that have nothing to do with justice . 
by giving to understand that maximum care is needed when dealing with the case , the presidential adviser makes an even bigger mistake . 
he adds yet another political blunder to his record . 
he drips another drop of anti - American spirit in to the collective mentality . 
Ioan Talpes adds something more to the spirit sown and fostered by Corneliu Vadim Tudor and co. 
had the pedophile been a Romanian citizen , he would have been busted right a way . 
but as he is an American , wait a minute , we don't want to make an error . 
you realize that against the background of debates over Marshal Antonescu , Corneliu Vadim Tudor 's hysterical reactions , the intensification of discussions about the consequences of Romania 's admission to NATO in November in Prague , such an opinion expressed by the presidential adviser does nothing but enhance a certain feeling of frustration and even prompt an anti - American attitude . 
Pampering Americans when it comes to crimes having a strong psychological impact on the population does nothing but stir an adverse reaction . 
from this point of view , all those who are keeping the data of Treptow case under wraps , all those who are trying to identify all sorts of extenuating circumstances are equally rendering non - services . 
to Romania and , to an equal extent , to the United States of America . 
the fact that Ioan Talpes is mixing the promotion of Romania 's history ( as seen by him ) with the sexual crimes committed by an individual ( be he a historian , a vet , a Romanian , Hungarian , British or American dyer ) does nothing but stir resentments that are of no use to anyone . 
not even to him . 
much less to Romania and the USA . 
Mr Talpes ' pampering resounds somewhere else .
