these days the eyes and ears of the Romanian citizen are being bombarded with all sort of publicity messages . 
aside from the usual ads - on chewing gum , coffee , detergents , cars , cigarettes , chocolate - political messages also show up . 
advertising , like political publicity , has prizes . 
if you collect I don't know how many beer or fizzy drink caps or unstick the labels of I don't know what products , put them all in an envelope and mail them to a certain address , you may be the winner of a car or a trip for two to some dreamlike place ( prizes in trips to the Moon or to the next world have not been offered as yet , but there will be soon enough ) . 
and the average man , tempted by the ad watched on TV or read in the newspapers , collects caps , labels , corks and coupons , gives the Romanian postmen a lot of work to do , then prepares for a wait . 
and he keeps waiting and waiting until he gets corns on his buttocks and still gets no promised car or trip . 
and he does not get them because at the other end there is no individual who is looking forward to sending two naives on a trip or to giving a way a car . 
at the other end there is a firm or a guy that wants to sell their / his merchandise . 
that 's all . 
if they want to give the prizes , they do it , if they don't , it cannot be helped ! 
who is to check and see whether they did give them or not ? 
nobody ! 
some of them are more astute . 
they hold the draw or nominate the winner , who is somebody from inside , so he signs for having received the prize but never gets to see the car or Paris . 
all this falls under everyday scams . 
few are the advertising campaigns which make a promise and keep it . 
as a rule , only big firms , afraid of not being involved in some scam , keep their word . 
but even in their case , the prize , tempting as it may sound , is still a very small part of a much bigger earning . 
let us return to politicians . 
they , too , make promises in their electoral ads . 
instead of a trip abroad , they offer you " a trip " to a better life . 
the second and third prize are a job each . 
thousands of other smaller prizes will be distributed after a draw . 
but nobody will check to make sure this does happen . 
all the publicity aimed at getting a vote has a sole purpose , to have you give it . 
nobody takes care of honouring promises . 
in the case of the raffles staged by various firms and promoted through advertising , the Consumer Protection Office has the right to step in . 
the institution is entitled to sanction the distribution and sale of counterfeit products , of the ones without a warranty or whose label does not match the contents . 
but who is to control the quality and contents of the political advertising during the election campaign ? 
nobody , it 's obvious . 
promises made in electoral ads are not checked , and shams are penalized by no institution . 
in their case , the elector alone is to decide in four years ' time whether he has got the promised " trip " or job . 
he plays the role of an inspector with the Politics consumer protection office . 
and his vote becomes sort of minutes to fine the politician or party from whom he has purchased a promise in exchange for a vote . 
the untrue publicity has spread over the newspapers , too . 
during the election campaign , TV and radio stations are to abide by a regulation which forbids them the broadcast of electoral publicity outside certain airtime . 
but there is no such regulation where newspapers are concerned . 
so these days in the various pages of some publications you may come a cross both official and concealed electoral publicity . 
what is concealed political publicity ? 
a presidential candidate or a party head drafts , at their campaign office , an interview . 
nice , polite questions only about achievements , only about prospects . 
the politician in question and his party are treasures to be cherished , or they are our most beautiful dreams come true , one would think judging by the text . 
they present themselves as unblemished , though everybody knows that the things are actually just the opposite . 
and they take the dull untrue text to a newspaper or magazine , pay double , and the interview is introduced in some page without the publicity mark on it . 
the ordinary man buys the newspaper or magazine , reads the fake and doesn't realize he is being duped . 
if these people with the paper or the magazine talk so nicely to mister X , it means that 's the way he really is . 
but the man has not read a real interview in the paper , but mere untrue publicity , a counterfeit sold as an editorial article . 
this as as close to fraud as the little car or trip . 
we dupe one another only to find in amazement in the end that we are all damaged .
